Uses 0-padding and a set width 8 characters of ensure that RGBA hexadecimal colors string representations are unambiguous.

e.g. (A: 00, R: 0, G: 0, B: 255) is now unambiguously printed as `0000FF00`, not `FF00`.

Replaces janky string substring and concatenation based ARGB -> RGBA shifting logic with bitwise operations to fix several bugs.

The previous code resulted in colors with low-alpha or R-channel values being printed incorrectly. For example, previously

(A: 0, R: 0, G: 160, B: 0) (ARGB: 0x0000A000) would be rendered as RGBA `00A0` which is not correct. Meanwhile, (A: 0, R: 0, G: 0, B: 0) would not render at all in RGBA leading to an exception. Please review the previous code's use of string operations to understand why.

### `contents.setDevToolsWebContents(devToolsWebContents)`

* `devToolsWebContents` WebContents

Uses the `devToolsWebContents` as the target `WebContents` to show devtools.

The `devToolsWebContents` must not have done any navigation, and it should not
be used for other purposes after the call.

By default Electron manages the devtools by creating an internal `WebContents`
with native view, which developers have very limited control of. With the
`setDevToolsWebContents` method, developers can use any `WebContents` to show
the devtools in it, including `BrowserWindow`, `BrowserView` and `<webview>`
tag.

An example of showing devtools in a `<webview>` tag:

```html
<html>
<head>
  <style type=""text/css"">
    * { margin: 0; }
    #browser { height: 70%; }
    #devtools { height: 30%; }
  </style>
</head>
<body>
  <webview id=""browser"" src=""https://github.com""></webview>
  <webview id=""devtools""></webview>
  <script>
    const browserView = document.getElementById('browser')
    const devtoolsView = document.getElementById('devtools')
    browserView.addEventListener('dom-ready', () => {
      const browser = browserView.getWebContents()
      browser.setDevToolsWebContents(devtoolsView.getWebContents())
      browser.openDevTools()
    })
  </script>
</body>
</html>
```

An example of showing devtools in a `BrowserWindow`:

```js
const {app, BrowserWindow} = require('electron')

let win = null
let devtools = null

app.once('ready', () => {
  win = new BrowserWindow()
  win.loadURL('https://github.com')
  win.show()
  devtools = new BrowserWindow({show: false})
  devtools.show()
  win.webContents.setDevToolsWebContents(devtools.webContents)
  win.webContents.openDevTools({mode: 'detach'})
})

### Non-style changes
`new Buffer()` is deprecated in Node core. I replaced the few use cases with the official Node recommendation (`Buffer.from()` and `Buffer.alloc()`). This should have no impact on the logic, but goes beyond a mere style-change.

### Style changes
The only notable new rule is `standard/no-callback-literal`, which forces us to use callbacks in the style of `callback(new Error('message')` instead of `callback('message')`. That'd be a breaking change - and most of our callbacks don't even have an error argument. That's a bit unfortunate, but without dwelling on this for too long, I disabled this rule where appropriate. If we want to change all our callbacks into one uniform format, we can always do so in Electron v2!

11176,"#11134 seems to be a very delicate race condition. No luck making an isolated demo, but here is a working theory:

- `URLRequest` hits a proxy while running on an IO thread
- `LoginHandler` is constructed, captures `render_process_host_id_`/`render_frame_id_` [at that moment, then posts a task to the UI thread](https://github.com/electron/electron/blob/master/atom/browser/login_handler.cc#L40)
- The original process or render frame dies somehow. Maybe the Window is closed, or navigation happens. *This is the race*
- The `RequestLogin` task finally executes on the UI thread
- [`App::OnLogin`](https://github.com/electron/electron/blob/master/atom/browser/api/atom_api_app.cc#L638) calls [`LoginHandler::GetWebContents()`](https://github.com/electron/electron/blob/master/atom/browser/login_handler.cc#L64) which returns null, either because `render_process_host_id_`/`render_frame_id_` are no longer valid, or because `RenderFrameHost` can't be mapped to a `WebContents`
- `App::OnLogin` tries to [construct a wrapper](https://github.com/electron/electron/blob/4d364fa27a6fa5803a25a343e40a2fe68e27b27f/atom/browser/api/atom_api_web_contents.cc#L1968) around the null `web_contents`, and ends up [crashing here](https://github.com/electron/electron/blob/4d364fa27a6fa5803a25a343e40a2fe68e27b27f/atom/browser/api/atom_api_web_contents.cc#L291)

The reason is simple: `Error` objects don't serialize. This is true for all of them (`ReferenceError`, `TypeError`, `URIError`, etc).

```js
const myError = new Error('Something went wrong')
JSON.stringify(myError) === '{}' // true

```js
webContents.executeJavaScript('Promise.reject(new Error(""Something went wrong""));')

**Background**

For extension's content scripts injection, Chromium relies on ""isolated world"".

> Content scripts execute in a special environment called an isolated world. They have access to the DOM of the page they are injected into, but not to any JavaScript variables or functions created by the page. It looks to each content script as if there is no other JavaScript executing on the page it is running on. The same is true in reverse: JavaScript running on the page cannot call any functions or access any variables defined by content scripts.

In Electron, the current implementation relies on `vm.runInThisContext` that does not have the same isolation properties.

**Objective**

This PR wants to add the necessary APIs to deal with isolated world and use it in content scripts injection.

**Done**

- Add `webframe.executeJavaScriptInIsolatedWorld`
- Add `webframe.setIsolatedWorldContentSecurityPolicy`
- Add `webframe.setIsolatedWorldHumanReadableName`
- Add `webframe.setIsolatedWorldSecurityOrigin`

**Todo**

- [x] Add documentation
- [x] Use plain JS object with optional properties instead of `code` and `url` parameters in `executeJavaScriptInIsolatedWorld` for map with [WebScriptSource](https://cs.chromium.org/chromium/src/third_party/WebKit/public/web/WebScriptSource.h?q=WebScriptSource&dr=CSs&l=31) functionalities 
- [x] Allow an array of WebScriptSource as parameter in `executeJavaScriptInIsolatedWorld`

### First try

At the end of that debugging session we'd decided to defer the singletons' instantiation until after `Object.setPrototypeOf(AutoUpdater.prototype, EventEmitter.prototype)` was called so that the newly-created AutoUpdater would have its EventEmitter parent fields initialized.

Unfortunately that's not going to work. Calling `new AutoUpdater()` in JS doesn't actually create a C++ AutoUpdater object because AutoUpdater and the other singletons don't insert a constructor into the JS bindings: (a) it's unnecessary binding code to (b) give clients the ability to create multiple instances of things designed to be singletons. So, while we _could_ add constructor bindings to make this possible, it opens up more potential problems.

### Second try

EventEmitter() defers its initialization to an `init()` helper function, and Samuel suggested that would work as well. I'm going to chalk this up to my inexperience with JS but I wasn't able to get `autoUpdater.init()` to work (and it _is_ defined a little differently from other members, ie `EventEmitter.init = function(){...}` vs. `EventEmitter.prototype.setMaxLixteners = function(){...}`) but IMO this is just as well because the approach I used is cleaner & should work even if Node [changes](https://github.com/nodejs/node/issues/10680) EventEmitter's internals.

10918,"I'm proposing this solution to the crash bug that we've been experiencing in Beaker when using custom protocols.

History:

 - There was a PR by @deepak1556 to solve this: https://github.com/electron/electron/pull/9358. That got reverted due to a regression (https://github.com/electron/electron/issues/9587).
 - Robo's suggested cause was ""Race between destruction of source and sink buffers caused UAF crash."" I wasn't able to confirm or disprove that (I'm still pretty new at this codebase).
 - This is the function in the chromium source that crashes:

```cpp
// url_request_job.cc
void URLRequestJob::ReadRawDataComplete(int result) {
  DCHECK(request_->status().is_io_pending());
  DCHECK_NE(ERR_IO_PENDING, result);

  // The headers should be complete before reads complete
  DCHECK(has_handled_response_);

  GatherRawReadStats(result);

  // Notify SourceStream.
  DCHECK(!read_raw_callback_.is_null());

  base::ResetAndReturn(&read_raw_callback_).Run(result);
  // |this| may be destroyed at this point.
}
```
 - It's being called by `URLRequestFetchJob::OnURLFetchComplete()` in electron. Through logging, I found that the crashes only occurred when `ReadRawDataComplete()` was called when `request_->status().is_io_pending() == false`.
 - Based on my read of `URLRequestJob`, I **believe** `ReadRawDataComplete()` only needs to be called if an async `ReadRawData()` is still in progress. I think the crash is occurring because there's no async read in progress, and `ReadRawDataComplete()` is blindly calling `read_raw_callback_` when it's a null reference. (However, because `read_raw_callback_` is private and I dont know how to do custom libchromiumcontent builds yet, I couldn't check its value to confirm that.)
 - The DCHECK against `is_io_pending()` at the top of `ReadRawDataComplete()` seems to confirm the check I'm doing.

Some file managers (ex: Nemo) don't return until some time after they are closed, this freezes the Electron application until the process returns.
The same is true about any application that can potentially be opened with OpenItem.

Is there any reason why this was set to true initially? It was introduced in [this commit](https://github.com/sneakypete81/electron/commit/79ba8feaf8485a0c7a94e717281d1e13deff9e6c) and it seems that it was just sent to true because the author didn't have a problem with applications opened with OpenItem or ShowItemInFolder hanging.

So a child window should be closed before parent window closed.

### Reproduce code

https://github.com/syohex/electron-app-quit-issue

`npm install && npm run start`

This example shows a window and show its child modal window. And then it calls `app.quit()` after three seconds. I expect that all windows are closed by `app.quit()` but parent window is not closed.

I checked this behavior by `lldb`. `NSWindow#performClose` does nothing(also delegate methods are not called) if child modal window still exists. Taking such behavior into consideration, a child window should be closed before parent window closed. (I could not find about this behavior from `NSWindow` document)

10365,"This is a fix for #10188 which was introduced by switching to dynamically linked CRT on Windows. The problem went unnoticed because it is mostly harmless other than recording the app crash in the Windows Event Log. It is desirable to merge this to master and to the 1.7 stream as well.

### Description:

Chromium has its own TLS subsystem which supports automatic destruction of thread-local data, and also depends on memory allocation routines provided by the CRT. The problem is that the auto-destruction mechanism uses a hidden feature of the OS loader which calls a callback on thread exit, but only after all loaded DLLs have been detached. Since the CRT is also a DLL, it happens that by the time Chromium's `OnThreadExit` function is called, the heap functions, though still in memory, no longer perform their duties, and when Chromium calls `free` on its buffer, it triggers an access violation error. 

The workaround is to invoke Chromium's `OnThreadExit` in time from within the CRT's atexit facility, ensuring the heap functions are still active. The second invocation from the OS loader code will be a no-op.",Externals,7,True,en

Prior to the release of Lion, fullscreen functionality on Mac OS X acted similarly to the current fullscreen functionality on Windows and Linux. This PR provides functionality to simulate that same style of pre-Lion fullscreen on macOS for Electron applications.

**Full Disclosure: This is my first attempt at writing Objective-C... ever... so _any_ feedback would be greatly appreciated!** üòÑ

### Usage

Simple fullscreen support can be enabled by passing `simpleFullscreen: true` to the `BrowserWindow` constructor which, when enabled, will override the default macOS fullscreen functionality with the new simple fullscreen functionality.

Additionally, two new methods (`setSimpleFullScreen()` and `isFullScreen()`) have been added for more granular usability.

### Demonstration

Here is a short animation that demonstrates what simple fullscreen support looks like (pay attention to the window, as it stays on the current space rather than moving to a new one, which is the default functionality).

This PR uses `performWindowDragWithEvent` where supported (10.11 and up) and good ol' window moving code on versions below. This PR also didn't have to do anything on Windows, where the window's `webkit-app-region` are already respected regardless of a BrowserView presence.

#### Why the window's draggable regions?
Despite my best efforts, I was completely unable to get the `-webkit-app-region`-regions for the content of the actual BrowserView. In addition, the BrowserView uses `inspectable_web_contents` instead of `web_contents`, which has a minor difference in the precise `NSView` class that is being returned from `GetNativeView()`. Long story short: I was unable to make it work, but this alternative ensures that you can use the BrowserView and still build apps with a custom frame and `webkit-app-region`.

*Also: This mirrors the behavior on Windows, where the window's drag regions also take control over dragging in the BrowserView*. Truly cross-platform :wink:",Externals,4,True,en

10183,"For top-level windows, setting the WS_EX_LAYERED and WS_EX_TRANSPARENT as done in `setIgnoreMouseEvents` styles effectively bypasses hit tests. This works great if the entire window should ignore mouse messages, but if we want to enable and disable bypassing based on where we are in the web page we are left in the dark since the browser window doesn't get any mouse messages anymore.

This PR solves this problem by adding a method `setForwardMouseMessages` to `BrowserWindow`. A low-level mouse hook manually sends WM_MOUSEMOVE messages to the browser window if it's in a state where it's forwarding mouse messages. This is enough for Chromium to generate events when entering/leaving HTML elements even when input is otherwise routed to underlying windows. Ultimately this allows us to stop forwarding when appropriate so that we may once again interact with the browser.

As a concrete example of where this was used, I made a transparent canvas that represents a hole the web page. Inside this area the window is treated as if it never existed. Moving out of the canvas once again acknowledges the window after disabling forwarding in the `mouseleave` event of the canvas.

I'm taking a stab at improving Handoff support as in #9622

    console.log(app.invalidateCurrentActivity);

**Summary**

In **Windows only**, starting an app in the fullscreen state i.e. with the BrowserWindow options `{ fullscreen: true }` produces an unresponsive window after toggling to the normal window state. e.g. Pressing F11 or `setFullScreen(false)`. See issue #6036

The window visibility flag `WS_VISIBLE` is never set for the `GWL_STYLE` when we start in fullscreen mode. This fix simply detects the fullscreen->normal window state transition and checks if the window is visible (which it always should be). If it isn't, it sets the visibility to true. i.e. :

```cpp
void NativeWindowViews::SetFullScreen(bool fullscreen) {
   bool fullscreen_to_normal_detected = IsFullscreen() && !fullscreen;
   ...
   if (fullscreen_to_normal_detected && !IsVisible()) {
       LONG frame_style = ::GetWindowLong(GetAcceleratedWidget(), GWL_STYLE);
       frame_style |= WS_VISIBLE;
       ::SetWindowLong(GetAcceleratedWidget(), GWL_STYLE, frame_style);
   }
   ...
}

9589,"Native modules used by specs used to be recompiled against the published headers hosted from https://atom.io/download/electron. This created issues whenever the node module version was bumped since the headers downloaded would be for a previous release and so the specs would fail with a message like: 

```
Error: The module 'runas' was compiled against a different Node.js version using NODE_MODULE_VERSION...
```

This problem would go away once the release was published since the correct headers would be downloaded in future builds.

In https://github.com/electron/electron/pull/9116 this was changed to compile the native modules against the local headers done via running `create-node-headers.py` during bootstrap and pointing `npm_config_nodedir` to that location.

That worked well on Linux and macOS, but failed on Windows since the `node.dll.lib` file needed to compile against was missing at bootstrap time since it is created by the build.

This pull request updates bootstrap to no longer install the spec modules and instead install them at test time or when explicitly requested via `npm run rebuild-test-modules`. Since tests are run after a build this should resolve the issue with the `.lib` file being present now.

### Summary

- `npm run bootstrap` is now faster since it does not install the `spec/node_modules` so people only building and not testing will have a quicker experience.
- `npm run rebuild-test-modules` is added that can be run at any time and will rebuild the test modules against the current headers, useful when switching branches.
- `npm test` will install/build the test modules when `spec/node_modules` does not exist yet.
- `npm test -- --rebuild_native_modules` will be run by `script/cibuild` so modules are always rebuilt on every CI run.
- Consolidate logic in specs where native modules support is checked for with new `nativeModulesEnabled` global.

Note to the reviewer(s):
Since i've no clue about writing C++ code i tried to keep the changes as small as possible and skipped the following potential improvements:
* `web_contents_getter.Run()` is now called twice during the request at [ShouldInterceptResourceAsStream](https://github.com/rreimann/electron/blob/2f08b55a8a21cdc6a340ec663afcb79b6f48b6fc/atom/browser/atom_resource_dispatcher_host_delegate.cc#L128) and at [OnPdfResourceIntercepted](https://github.com/rreimann/electron/blob/2f08b55a8a21cdc6a340ec663afcb79b6f48b6fc/atom/browser/atom_resource_dispatcher_host_delegate.cc#L69). If i'd known the required syntax i would have called it just once and passed the resulting `WebContents` to `OnPdfResourceIntercepted`

* After adding `IsPluginsEnabled` to the existing methods `IsSandboxed` and `UsesNativeWindowOpen` there are now [three methods](https://github.com/rreimann/electron/blob/2f08b55a8a21cdc6a340ec663afcb79b6f48b6fc/atom/browser/web_contents_preferences.cc#L202-L246) that seem widely redundant. I did't know if the preexisting redundancy was intentional so i didn't try to extract a common method for all of them.

Test repo: https://github.com/tonyganch/electron-quick-start/tree/history-regression

**TL;DR:** Current implementation of NavigationController does not allow using
`history.pushState()` if page url is not changed.
I think it worked by mistake in versions < 1.3.6 and got visible after fix 180a77e6.

**The issue:** live.com website uses `history.pushState()` and `history.back()` to navigate between different views of login form. Click on ""Sign in"" button calls `history.pushState({viewId: viewId}, '')` and click on ""Back"" button calls `history.back()`.
On `history.pushState()` NavigationController checks if the url of the page has changed and if not, then it doesn't push new state to history, meaning that `history.pushState()` called from js does absolutely nothing.
When the page then tries to call `history.back()`, NavigationController checks if the history is empty, sees that it is and does nothing (which makes sense).

Electron has its implementation of NavigationController which was introduced by this commit: 0143a4548869c1e8201ef3c3b6c2e098d5dd5140.
You can see that on line 19 we added the check if the page has the same url or a new one:

I don't see such check in previous code which makes me think that maybe it was introduced by mistake?

Restructure
===========
The biggest part of this change is getting access to the event emitting methods of the `atom::api::WebContents` class from the `atom::AtomJavaScriptDialogManager` class.  That requirement led me to shuffling around a couple dependencies.

I based the changes to `atom::AtomJavaScriptDialogManager` on the existing `atom::BluetoothChooser` class: have a constructor that accepts an `api::WebContents*` object, save a reference to it, and use its `Emit` method later.

The second part of that change is in constructing the `atom::AtomJavaScriptDialogManager` object.  Right now creating and managing that `dialog_manager` object happens in the `atom::CommonWebContentsDelegate` base class, which isn't ideal for this change since it doesn't have access to any of the Emit methods.  So I moved that (including all references to `atom::AtomJavaScriptDialogManager`) into the `atom::api::WebContents` class.

One thing that makes me a little nervous about that change is this comment from `common_web_contents_delegate.h`:

```cpp
  // The stored InspectableWebContents object.
  // Notice that web_contents_ must be placed after dialog_manager_, so we can
  // make sure web_contents_ is destroyed before dialog_manager_, otherwise a
  // crash would happen.
  std::unique_ptr<brightray::InspectableWebContents> web_contents_;
```

The `dialog_manager_` field is in a subclass now, so it should still be destroyed before `web_contents_` field.  But this change does affect the destruction order, so if there are any other dependencies on the destruction order then it's possible that some other problem could come from this.


Reloads
=======
One additional piece of information that the `RunBeforeUnloadDialog` method has is an `is_reload` flag.  The Chromium browser uses that to choose a different title for the confirmation dialog if the unload is for a reload (`Do you want to reload this site?` instead of `Do you want to leave this site?`).

Originally I planned to make that `is_reload` flag available in the new `will-prevent-unload` event.  But in my testing the flag was always false, even for a reload (using the reload menu option from the default app).  So at least for now, I left the `is_reload` flag out since it would be misleading to provide it if it doesn't work, and it would probably be possible to add later if there's a demand for it.",Externals,17,True,en

9242,"This is the second half of #9099 - adding the certificate trust API for Windows.

### The Setup

I've configured a local IIS instance with a self-signed certificate to trigger this failure over HTTPS. Edge and IE don't like it, and spit this error out at the user:

![](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/359239/25258894/04a31a94-2686-11e7-8108-df5b1a2e4949.png)

I can write up the way to setup this environment locally if others want to test this flow out themselves. The sample app I've been using can be found here: [shiftkey/electron-test-network-windows](https://github.com/shiftkey/electron-test-network-windows)

### User Experience

The magic in `certificate_trust_win.cc` is some code I've tested in isolation to resolve the above error. It installs the received certificate to the **Trusted Root Certificate** for the current user (not the local computer) and because we're only doing it for the current user it doesn't require elevation.

However, interacting with the trusted root certificate store will trigger this dialog when you invoke `CertAddCertificateContextToStore`:

<img width=""534"" src=""https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/359239/25259025/d31180fa-2686-11e7-9ba3-aadf9f74acaf.png"">

It's certainly not as pretty (or as functional) as the macOS equivalent, but that might be okay for now. As a result I'm also not using the `message` argument that `ShowCertificateTrust` receives. I'm open to putting more context into this flow based on feedback and security concerns - this is just a first pass.

### Testing

I'm currently at the point where the test app has the right IPC setup to trigger the certificate error, but I'm missing something with the ""swap in a debug version"" process and the `dialog.showCertificateTrustDialog` method isn't visible on Windows (there's nothing in the [original PR](https://github.com/electron/electron/pull/9099/files#diff-e90f5a18d6eb6b4377f52d724fd00dacR285) to suggest this is being hidden deliberately).

Here's my flow for testing this PR (I've probably missed something):

- I [added an `#if defined` here](https://github.com/electron/electron/commit/dca08c208bccafe36b3cea4c3b37898d2b7af51c#diff-43c33d11ff91ca9828c023eeddcd2665R132)
- `python script\bootstrap.py --msvs` to get a VS solution file
- `npm run build` to get a debug build of my branch
- copy `out\D\*` to `node_modules\electron\dist\` 

I can then run the test harness, attach to the `electron.exe` processes and VS loads the PDB symbols for electron.exe and node.exe.

**UPDATE:** there's something up with how `electron.asar` is being packaged for debug builds - I've repackaged that archive with the `showCertificateTrustDialog` method and I can launch the dialog in the app.

### TODO

- [x] test flow end-to-end in sample app
- [x] refresh certificate database if added
- [x] handle failure cases in `ShowCertificateTrust` gracefully, ensuring we cleanup any resources

visibility properties and `visibilitychange` event so this gets rid of
most of our custom logic for `BrowserWindow` and `BrowserView`.

Note that `webview` remains unchanged and is still affected by the issues
listed below.

User facing changes:

- The `document` visibility properties and `visibilitychange` event are
  now also updated/fired in response to occlusion changes on macOS. In
  other words, `document.visibilityState` will now be `hidden` on macOS
  if the window is occluded by another window.

- Previously, `visibilitychange` was also fired by *both* Electron and
  Chromium in some cases (e.g. when hiding the window). Now it is only
  fired by Chromium so you no longer get duplicate events.

- The visiblity state of `BrowserWindow`s created with `{ show: false }`
  is now initially `visible` until the window is shown and hidden.

- The visibility state of `BrowserWindow`s with `backgroundThrottling`
  disabled is now permanently `visible`.

9166,"Right now, `<webview>` is the only way to embed additional content in a `BrowserWindow`. Unfortunately `<webview>` suffers from a [number of problems](https://github.com/electron/electron/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue%20is%3Aopen%20label%3Awebview%20). To make matters worse, many of these are upstream Chromium bugs instead of Electron-specific bugs.

For us at [Figma](https://www.figma.com), the main issue is very slow performance.

Despite the upstream improvements to `<webview>` through the OOPIF work, it is probable that there will continue to be `<webview>`-specific bugs in the future.

Therefore, this introduces a `<webview>` alternative to called `BrowserView`, which...

- is a thin wrapper around `api::WebContents` (so bugs in `BrowserView` will
  likely also be bugs in `BrowserWindow` web contents)

- is instantiated in the main process like `BrowserWindow` (and unlike
  `<webview>`, which lives in the DOM of a `BrowserWindow` web contents)

- needs to be added to a `BrowserWindow` to display something on the screen

This implements the most basic API. The API is expected to evolve and change in the near future and has consequently been marked as experimental. Please do not use this API in production unless you are prepared to deal with breaking changes.

An example use case for this method: A few games on Steam use Electron and [Greenworks](https://github.com/greenheartgames/greenworks). Steam games have an in-game overlay that shows up over the game, which users can toggle via a keybind. This overlay has many issues in electron apps. 

The main issue is that since the overlay is hooked into the renderer, the overlay is frozen / corrupted when the renderer isn't painting or if it's only painting small dirty regions. We used to implement some shady methods to force repaints, such as having multiple 1x1 pixel canvases refreshing, or translateZ(0)ing some elements.. but these hacks stopped working properly in newer Chromium versions.

- Webview will still inherit embedder zoom changes. (this behavior is already present and it will continue)
- The zoom changes of each host in a session are persisted with the Preference file, so they will be available on the next load of the app. (If ZoomFactor is set on the webPreference then it will take precedence over the values from preference file, this can be overriden by using the zoom apis).

## The problems this fixes
- The parent window tries to process non-client events for frameless. This results in borders being added (was not present with Chromium 53, but presented itself with Chromium 54)
- Because of a bug in the menu adjustment code, the web contents object ends up being incorrectly sized. This causes borders to be added when at a DPI > 100% on Chromium 54 (53 does not show them).

## History / description

I had originally submitted a ""fix"" with https://github.com/electron/electron/pull/7416, which @zcbenz accepted (and later reverted with https://github.com/electron/electron/pull/7461, because it failed the tests).  I believe this fix masked the issue in Chromium 53.

When upgrading our fork of Electron to Chromium 54 for Brave, we noticed various issues when DPI is greater than 100%.  I spent at least a week digging into the Chromium code and discovered the root causes.  Remembering the reverted PR above helped when troubleshooting.

8357,"When Electron tries to call a method in a deceased renderer it throws an exception. This behavior makes the `remote` module a bit of a hornet's nest, because it's quite easy to listen to events from the main process but often non-trivial to clean them up properly. Instead of crashing, we could dig into the underlying `EventEmitter` and remove the listeners that are hooked to `callIntoRenderer`. We could also display a `console.warn` so that the user knows they did something bad and still has a chance to fix it.

In addition this PR adds the names of the remote events to the error message, to make them easier to find. Increasingly often methods are wrapped in higher-level abstractions such as `Promise` or `Observable` so `meta.location` is not enough information on its own. The new warning looks like:

```

8348,"This pull request adds support for running the `preload` script and Electron APIs in a separate, isolated JavaScript context from the main JavaScript context of the loaded page.

This ensures the loaded page can't tamper with any JavaScript built-ins (such as `Array.prototype.push`, `JSON.parse`, etc.) that the preload script and Electron APIs make use of.

The `preload` script still has full access to the DOM, `document`, and `window` globals via secure proxies that prevent leakage across the contexts. This is provided by reusing Chrome's built-in support for [content scripts](https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/content_scripts#execution-environment).

This option is completely opt-in and no existing behavior is changed.

## Example

Shown below is an application that loads a page (possibly remote/untrusted) but wants to open any clicked links in an external browser using Electron's `shell` API.

This example also shows how variables can be injected into the loaded page and how the preload script can listen for messages from the page using `window.postMessage`.

const {app, BrowserWindow} = require('electron')

      contextIsolation: true,
      preload: path.join(__dirname, 'preload.js')
    }
  })
  window.loadURL(`file://${__dirname}/index.html`)
})
```

### `preload.js`

```js
const {shell, webFrame} = require('electron')
const path = require('path')

// Set a variable in the page before it loads
webFrame.executeJavaScript('window.foo = ""foo"";')

// The loaded page will not be able to access this, it is only available
// in this context
window.bar = 'bar'

document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', () => {
  // Will log out 'undefined' since window.foo is only available in the main
  // context
  console.log(window.foo)

  // Will log out 'bar' since window.bar is available in this context
  console.log(window.bar)

  document.body.addEventListener('click', (event) => {
    // Open clicked links externally
    if (event.target.tagName === 'A') {
      shell.openExternal(event.target.href)
      event.preventDefault()
    }
  })
})

window.addEventListener('message', (event) => {
  // Beep when the page requests it
  if (event.data === 'beep') {
    shell.beep()
  }
})

Previously this was registered using a `.once` but it looks like render views are deleted asynchronously so sometimes the new render view would be created and the listener registered before the previous delete event fired. This would cause both to get deleted when the old one was eventually deleted since they were both listening and there was no process id checks done for the deleted render view.

This pull request switches to using a `.on` listener and waiting for the deleted render view process id to match the process id being listened to which ensures the registry is only cleared when the proper render view has been deleted.

Reading some references on how to handle drops in cocoa ([1](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/DragandDrop/Tasks/DraggingFiles.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/20001288-102943), [2](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5663887/drag-and-drop-with-nsstatusitem)) I noticed they all process the drop from `performDragOperation` instead of `draggingEnded`, like Electron does. And updating it to use the former fixed this issue here: it's now triggering the callback for raw text and urls 100% of the time.

I've never done a PR here so apologies in advance if I'm missing things. 
- Linter is valid
- Some tests are failing but it doesn't feel like this is due to my code. 

I added some documentation too. 

A few things I'm unsure about: 
- Not sure if I have to do anything for other platforms. 
- Not sure about memory. 

```
- (void)previewFileAtPath:(NSString *)filepath  withName:(NSString *) name {
  NSURL * url = [[NSURL alloc] initFileURLWithPath:filepath];
  [self setQuickLookItem:[[AtomPreviewItem alloc] initWithURL:url title:name]];
  [[QLPreviewPanel sharedPreviewPanel] makeKeyAndOrderFront:nil];
}
```

Should I release the url here?

Happy to fix all the issues, and thanks for the feedbacks,

",Internals,73,True,en
7577,"This pull request proposes a new electron module called the net module. It is essentially a JavaScript binding of Chromium native networking library (the net library) and provides an API similar to the Node.js HTTP module.

Currently, Electron apps developers are expected to use the native Node.js, or other helper libraries built on top of it, to issue their HTTP(S) requests. However, it is widely known that Node.js provides a quite minimal support for web proxies.

Using Chromium network stack offers substantial advantages over the HTTP/HTTPS implementation of Node.js, specifically regarding web proxies‚Äô support. Following is a non-exhaustive list of such features:
- Automatic management of system proxy configuration, support of wpad protocol and proxy pac configuration files.
- Tunneling of HTTPS requests.
- Support for authenticating proxies using basic, digest, NTLM, Kerberos or negotiate authentication schemes.
- Traffic monitoring proxies: Fiddler-like proxies used for access control and monitoring.

While it is possible to provide support for most of the previously listed features on top of Node.js, eventually using additional npm packages, the task is not trivial and requires a substantial development effort and testing. Moreover, we are not aware of any public npm package that solves the authenticating proxies‚Äô issue.

The initial design of Node.js as server-side platform explains while it has always lacked reasonable support for web proxies as the latters are typically deployed in client environments. 

Electron, being primarily targeted as a client-side framework, is expected to provide a robust networking API capable of automatically handling all issues introduced by usage of web proxies.

The present module solves all of the aforementioned problems. The API is quite simple and greatly mimics the familiar Node.j HTTP. So no substantial learning effort is required.

The implementation of the net module follows the usual binding patterns of electron. It extends the JavaScript context of the browser process by adding a new module. Applicative code not using the new module wouldn‚Äôt be impacted in any aspect.

On the other hand, applications willing to use the new module would automatically benefit from a robust and widely used networking layer targeted for client-side environments.

Basically this handles `executeJavaScript` calls returning instances of `Promise` and resolving that promise before passing it back through IPC to the caller.

This trick works because

``` js
Promise.resolve(123).then((resolvedValue) => console.log(resolvedValue))
// This would print out 123
// Promise.resolve either immediately resolves with the given value or resolves the given promise
```

It allows for truly asyncronous execution like so

``` js
webContents.executeJavaScript(
  `new Promise(resolve => {
    setTimeout(() => resolve('myString'), 2000);
  });`,
  (returnValue) => {
     // returnValue === 'myString'
  }

This brings up a broader discussion about which (or all) Electron API event emitters should be configured to have infinite listeners. `webFrame` and `webContents` already have this enabled but perhaps this should be enabled for all Electron APIs since 10 listeners is pretty low.

7428,"This pull request is an attempt to get the specs green on the Windows CI machines, they are currently failing on a focused web contents spec that seems to be caused by a window left around after the sandbox specs.

If you run the `should open windows in another domain with cross-scripting disabled` spec locally you can see the popup window sticks around after the spec finishes.

I added an explicitly listener and close call for this window so it doesn't impact later running specs.

While creating a new release and testing our project with that fix, we ended up seeing more weird behavior on high DPI screens.

7001,"In commit https://github.com/nodejs/node/commit/4d4cfb27ca7718c7df381ac3b257175927cd17d1, some changes were made to how Node supports the `--debug-brk` flag that caused Electron's support for it to stop working in 1.3.0+.

From that commit's message:

> Do not depend on the existence of global.v8debug as a mechanism to
>   determine if --debug-brk was specified.

Excerpts from that commit's diff:

``` diff
-  if (debug_wait_connect) {
-    const char expose_debug_as[] = ""--expose_debug_as=v8debug"";
-    V8::SetFlagsFromString(expose_debug_as, sizeof(expose_debug_as) - 1);
-  }
```

``` diff
+  // --debug-brk
+  if (debug_wait_connect) {
+    READONLY_PROPERTY(process, ""_debugWaitConnect"", True(env->isolate()));
+  }
```

``` diff
-        if (global.v8debug &&
+        if (process._debugWaitConnect &&
```

``` diff
-      global.v8debug.Debug.setListener(function() {});
-      global.v8debug.Debug.setBreakPoint(compiledWrapper, 0, 0);
+      delete process._debugWaitConnect;
+      const Debug = vm.runInDebugContext('Debug');
+      Debug.setBreakPoint(compiledWrapper, 0, 0);
```

This pull request sets `process._debugWaitConnect` to `true` when `--debug-brk` is specified on the command line and removes setting `--expose_debug_as=v8debug` which is no longer used by Node.

It looks like removing the `HasRealNamedCallbackProperty` to get this working initially in #6776 has caused certain objects, specifically the `http.ClientRequest` object in Node to now cause crashes when serialized over IPC.

This pull requests adds a `InternalFieldCount` check that prevents the crash but also removes support for DOM objects over IPC.

I'm not sure if there is another way to fix this to keep DOM objects working but prevent the crashes since the stack trace for the current crash is pretty deep in v8: https://cs.chromium.org/chromium/src/v8/src/objects.cc?l=2981

It also adds a `--enable-sandbox` command-line option that enables chromium OS-level sandbox for all renderers, and if this option is passed, then all `BrowserWindow` instances will have the `sandboxed` option passed automatically(since they would not work otherwise).

This PR also restores chromium native `window.open` API for sandboxed windows as there should be no issue in having multiple webContents for one sandboxed renderer(since there's no node.js context)

While the PR is relatively big, it is mostly made of required infrastructure changes to support the new code. The implementation is relatively simple: For renderers with the `sandboxed` option enabled, the  `AtomSandboxedRendererClient` class is used. This class is unrelated to `AtomRendererClient` as it takes a very different approach to inject preload scripts and expose the `ipcRenderer` module(I've tried to reuse as much as possible, though). To support a basic commonjs environment in sandboxed renderers, browserify is used and integrated into the build system.

However Node turns off the `AutorunMicrotasks` of V8, making the resolution of `Promise`s to be delayed. So the app of devtools is started before its runtime bindings get ready.

Or we could add an instance var to track whether the dock is in the process of showing?

I tested this in the electron-quick-start app with:

``` js
setInterval(function(){
  console.log('dock visible:', app.dock.isVisible())
  if (app.dock.isVisible()) {
    app.dock.hide()
    console.log('after hide:', app.dock.isVisible())
    console.log('-')
  } else {
    app.dock.show()
    console.log('after show:', app.dock.isVisible())
    setTimeout(function(){

      console.log('-')

  }
}, 1000)

dock visible: true
after hide: false
-
dock visible: false

-

after hide: false
-

6620,"For applications showing ""popover"" style windows when the tray icon is clicked, it is nice to highlight the tray icon background for the entirety of when the window is open (like screenhero, dropbox, 1password, etc. do).

Previously the icon would highlight only when clicked but the highlight would go away on mouse up.

Now you can control when the highlight goes away explicitly so you can maintain the highlighted background until your window is closed.

Since there was already a `tray.setHighlightMode(mode)` API, I expanded that API to take a string enum instead of a boolean.

The possible values are:
- `'always'` - Always highlight the tray icon
- `'never'` - Never highlight the tray icon, previously equivalent to`tray.setHighlightMode(false)`.
- `'selection'` - Highlight the icon when clicked and when the context menu is open (the default), previously equivalent to calling `tray.setHighlightMode(true)`.

It still handles a `boolean` param so it should be backwards compatible with the previous behavior.

This is primarily to confirm that the download of a given ZIP completed successfully, as opposed to verifying that an Electron team member uploaded the given ZIP files (which would require using a trusted GPG key).

The reason why I would like to add this feature to the release process is that I'm a maintainer of the [Electron Packager](https://github.com/electron-userland/electron-packager) project, and we sometimes get GitHub issues filed where ultimately, the problem is that the download of Electron from GitHub releases didn't complete successfully. If this PR is merged, my goal is to add functionality to [electron-download](https://github.com/electron-userland/electron-download) that emulates `sha256sum -c` on the downloaded file.

From the [styleguide](https://github.com/electron/electron/blob/master/docs/styleguide.md):

> API classes or classes that are part of modules must be listed under a `## Class: TheClassName` chapter.

and

> Instance Methods must be listed under an `### Instance Methods` chapter.

This PR attempts to properly capitalize references to the `NativeImage` class and fix the heading levels.

@zcbenz, based on our recent conversation about extracting all classes (of which many can exist in a ""module"" like `session`), I think the resultant API array will have an object for the `nativeImage` an another for the `NativeImage` class, so it will look something like this:

``` js
[
  {
    name: 'nativeImage'
    type: 'module'
    methods: [
      {name: 'createEmpty', ...},
      {name: 'createFromPath', ...},
      {name: 'createFromBuffer', ...},
      {name: 'createFromDataURL', ...}
    ]
  },
  {
    name: 'NativeImage'
    type: 'class'
    instanceMethods: [
      {name: 'toPNG', ...},
      {name: 'toJPEG', ...},
      {name: 'getNativeHandle' ...},
      {name: 'createFromDataURL' ...}
    ]
  }

When using Buffer shims in your application, such as https://www.npmjs.com/package/buffer, the IPC via remote currently handles TypedArrays (eg. UInt8Array) as objects and fails to transport the values as function params or return values.

This PR will add support for transporting TypedArrays between the renderer and main process. TypedArrays get converted to regular Arrays on the sending side (remote) and to Node.js Buffers on the receiving side (rpc-server).

Read the spec but wasn't sure if I should add a test and where to put it, so there's no test for this change. If you want to test this, I'd be happy to add one if you can advice where to put it.

  document.getElementById('drag').ondragstart = (event) => {
    event.preventDefault()
    ipcRenderer.send('ondragstart', '/path/to/item')
  }
</script>
```

In the main process:

``` javascript
ipcMain.on('ondragstart', (event, filePath) => {
  event.sender.startDrag({

`app.launcher` is probably not a good name because `launcher` also means a popular type of programs, and since we are making `setBadgeCount` work on other platforms, there is no meaning to keep the `app.launcher` set of APIs.

Also for the `isCounterBadgeAvailable` API, generally for cross-platform APIs they should usually silently fail on platforms that do not support them, so users don't have to worry about platform differences.

Node's implementation got some great improvements via https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/5172 and this pull request seeks to use those improvements via post-processing the results of the default implementation instead of reimplementing the method fully.

- [x] Use default `Module._nodeModulePaths` implementations and filter results in patched version
- [x] Profile it üèá

This was profiled by calling `Module._nodeModulePaths` using 1,000 paths that were all inside the app's resources path so the filtering is happening on every call.

It looks to be a 50-75% speed improvement, results below.

``` js
var path = require('path')
var Module = require('module')
var paths = require('./paths')

module.exports = function () {
  var start = Date.now()
  var count = 0
  var total = 0
  for (var i = 0; i < paths.length; i++) {

    total += Module._nodeModulePaths(paths[i]).length
  }

  var time = Date.now() - start

## Parent and child windows

By using `parent` option, you can create child windows:

``` javascript
let top = new BrowserWindow()
let child = new BrowserWindow({parent: top})
```

The `child` window will always show on top of the `top` window.
### Modal windows

A modal window is a child window that disables parent window, to create a modal
window, you have to set both `parent` and `modal` options:

``` javascript
let child = new BrowserWindow({parent: top, modal: true, show: false})
child.loadURL('https://github.com')
child.once('ready-to-show', () => {
  child.show()
})
```
### Platform notices
- On macOS the child windows will keep the relative position to parent window
  when parent window moves, while on Windows and Linux child windows will not
  move.
- On Windows it is not supported to change parent window dynamically.
- On Linux the type of modal windows will be changed to `dialog`.
- On Linux many desktop environments do not support hiding a modal window.

This pull request does not add deprecation warnings either for the old versions. Since 1.0 just came out it seems a bit premature to start spamming the log with deprecation warnings.

Deprecation warnings should eventually be added for these but only when the 2.0 API picture is clearer while still giving people months to adjust before they get removed (like the 1.0 plan).

#### solution
- support non-native promises
#### discussion

there is a lot of talk on how-to-detect if something is a promise or not.  many people respond to the question with something like ""don't try to detect a promise, just `Promise.resolve` it if you need promise behavior.""  it's a strange response that doesn't address the intent of question--how to do proper type detection on Promises.  it's tricky because a Promise describes both a formal type as well as a behavioral expectation.  due to this complication, detecting a promise is not so simple. @zcbenz already denoted that a simple `.then` check is out of the question, and right fully so.  hence, the strategy taken should cover ~99.9% of promise implementations, with the downside that it takes many type checks to reach a conclusion.

This appears to be because people are accidentally (or on purpose) running `npm install electron` inside their apps which then makes `require('electron')` return the [electron npm module](https://www.npmjs.com/package/electron) instead of the internal Electron module with all the expected properties.

Then things like the quick start app and other examples will not work since none of the properties are present and the stack trace appears confusing when they open issues.

This pull request patches `Module._resolveFilename` to always return the internal Electron module when running `require('electron')`. This seems to be consistent with node's other built-ins like `fs`, `path`, etc. that can't be overridden and always return the internal versions when required even when their is a local module by that name in the app's `node_modules/` folder.

- https://github.com/nodejs/node/blob/master/lib/child_process.js#L90
- https://github.com/nodejs/node/blob/master/lib/child_process.js#L99

Electron patches `child_process.execFile` to add support for `asar`
archives by injecting logic that extracts the required files from the
`asar` to a temporary location before delegating the work to the
original `child_process.execFile`.

In order to decide whether to inject the custom `asar` extracting logic,
Electron makes use of a helper function called `splitPath()`. See:
- https://github.com/electron/electron/blob/master/lib/common/asar.js#L37

If the first argument of the returned array equals `true`, means that
the path is considered to be an `asar` archive, and thus the extraction
logic takes place. The problem is that if the command passed to
`child_process.execFile` _contains_ a path to an asar archive, padded
with other commands/arguments, `splitPath()` will consider it to be an
`asar` archive, and will try to extract it, throwing a rightfully
`Invalid package` error.

- In the conditional check to see if the first argument was a `BrowserWindow`, we were checking to see if `window` was `null` and then immediately checking it again in the ternary.

This PR also adds a `purgeCaches` method that attempts to free memory that is no longer being used (i.e. images from a previous navigation, etc etc):

Note that blindly calling this method probably makes Electron slower since it will have to refill these emptied caches, you should only call it if an event in your app has occured that makes you think your page is actually using less memory (i.e. you have navigated from a super heavy page to a mostly empty one, and intend to stay there)

5378,"This resolves #38. Read the issue for context, but after debugging the problem looks like this:

When a pty is in the uv kqueue, the poll kqueue does not properly clear the event after receiving it. The obvious fix would be to add `EV_CLEAR` to the event flags so that it is definitely cleared after receiving any event, however this causes a race condition in Darwin. The poll kqueue is signaled before the uv kqueue, resulting in the uv thread running once, seeing no events, and going back to sleep, while simultaneously the poll thread clears its kqueue out. This results in events being delayed until the next event comes in. You can verify that this is a race condition by adding `EV_CLEAR` to the original kevent call and then adding a sleep at the end of `PollEvents`

The code is simply waiting for data to be available for reading on the uv kqueue file descriptor, which `select` also does. I have migrated the Darwin-specific uv polling code to use `select` instead of kqueue.

I've verified that events still get processed like they should on El Capitan 10.11.3 (15D21).

Note: `poll` doesn't work on kqueues, otherwise I would have used that instead.

After some poking around, it seems like the only way you‚Äôre supposed to be able to get the state we are looking for is `WebContents::GetFrameTree()->root()->IsLoading()`, but `GetFrameTree` is not included in Chromium‚Äôs publicly exported headers.

Instead, I synthesized a similar bit of state based on `WebContentsObserver` callbacks. I don‚Äôt know that this approach is really all that great, but it‚Äôs the best I could think of.

A few thoughts with implementation
- Currently the trust bits for the CA certs are set by the api internally otherwise certificate verification will fail for untrusted. Should this be exposed as another api and let users set the trust bits ?
- Does the current options object serve all purposes for client certificate import ? Or is there any other format users would like to provide ?
- The api is implemented only for linux, for other platforms chromium invokes the platform certificate manager whose implementation can be found in [settings_utils::ShowManageSSLCertificates](https://code.google.com/p/chromium/codesearch#chromium/src/chrome/browser/ui/webui/settings_utils.h&l=24).

``` js
let stringify = remote.getGlobal('JSON').stringify
stringify({})
```

In normal JS this is not a problem because the methods are objects themselves and rely on `this` pointer when being called. However in Electron the problem is the member methods of remote objects are not real functions, they just only records the object and the method's name, and send them to the main process when being called.

This PR works around it by referencing the remote object in its remote member methods, so as long as the methods are stored by user the remote object would never be garbage collected.

A real solution should be treating member methods as real functions, and get the remote object from the `this` pointer. But let's try it in another PR.

This PR switches to drawing the image manually. The `drawRect` function decides whether to use `image` or `alternateImage`(pressed image) and then if that image is marked as a template, it fills it with the same color used for the text before drawing it.

I've verified this in a couple tests, not sure if more are needed:

- Tray with non-template `image`, template `pressed image`
- Tray with non-template `image`, non-template `pressed image`

1. I was originally hoping to make this an argument on the actual dialog.show\* calls, but it seems the parameter set is defined in `libchromiumcontent` and I wasn't sure it would be appropriate to add there?

Setting up clear, automated contributor expectations makes a project healthier.
## The Rules
- **2 spaces** ‚Äì for indentation
- **Single quotes for strings** ‚Äì except to avoid escaping
- **No unused variables** ‚Äì this one catches _tons_ of bugs!
- **No semicolons** ‚Äì [It's](http://blog.izs.me/post/2353458699/an-open-letter-to-javascript-leaders-regarding) [fine.](http://inimino.org/~inimino/blog/javascript_semicolons) [Really!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsfbh17Ax9I)
- **Never start a line with `(` or `[`**
  - This is the **only** gotcha with omitting semicolons ‚Äì _automatically checked for you!_
  - [More details](RULES.md#semicolons)
- **Space after keywords** `if (condition) { ... }`
- **Space after function name** `function name (arg) { ... }`
- Always use `===` instead of `==` ‚Äì but `obj == null` is allowed to check `null || undefined`.
- Always handle the node.js `err` function parameter
- Always prefix browser globals with `window` ‚Äì except `document` and `navigator` are okay
  - Prevents accidental use of poorly-named browser globals like `open`, `length`,
    `event`, and `name`.

For more details, see https://github.com/feross/standard/blob/master/RULES.md
## The Refactor

I kicked off the refactor using [standard-format](http://npm.im/standard-format) to automatically convert much of the code. This got me a long way, but the tool [has its share of issues](https://github.com/maxogden/standard-format/issues). Sometimes it chokes on files containing valid syntax, and sometimes it overlooks files that contain invalid syntax. `¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø`

After squeezing everything I could out of `standard-format`, I removed it from the dependencies because we probably won't need automated code refactoring once this refactor rolls out.

Next I installed [snazzy](http://npm.im/snazzy), a wrapper around `standard` that produces glamorous and colorful output. This was nice because it made the process of manual code cleanup much more... pleasant. As I made changes, I committed them often to ensure the test suite continued to pass.

Once I got all the code cleaned up, I uninstalled `snazzy` in favor of vanilla `standard` for a few reasons:
1. `standard` is more actively maintained than `snazzy`
2. `standard` is a more recognizable name for the dependency
3. `snazzy`'s output is a little buggy sometimes
## The Most Common Fixes

Here's a sorted list of the most common errors, generated by [standard-summary](https://github.com/zeke/standard-summary#readme):

```
5966   Extra semicolon
1615   Missing space before function parentheses
380    'it' is not defined

38     Expected { after 'if' condition
26     'afterEach' is not defined

5      Do not use 'new' for side effects
3      Infix operators must be spaced
...
```
## Globals

The test suite contains a number of global variables, mostly from mocha: `after`, `afterEach`, `before`, `beforeEach`, `Blob`, `btoa`, `describe`, `DevToolsAPI`, `Event`, `fetch`, `HTMLElement`, `HTMLObjectElement`, `InspectorFrontendHost`, `it`, `location`, `MutationObserver`, `Response`, `self`, `SharedWorker`, `URL`, `WebInspector`, `WebSocket`, `WebView`, `Worker`, `xdescribe`, `xit`.

These globals are whitelisted in a few different ways:
1. a `standard.globals` array in package.json is used for the most common repeat offenders, like mocha and jquery.
2. a `/* globals foo, bar */` comment at the top of the offending file, for less commonly used globals.
   
   For more info, see the [standard docs about globals](https://github.com/feross/standard#i-use-a-library-that-pollutes-the-global-namespace-how-do-i-prevent-variable-is-not-defined-errors)

``` json
{
  ""standard"": {
    ""globals"": [""$"", ""after"", ""afterEach"", ""before"", ""beforeEach"", ""describe"", ""it"", ""location""]
  }
}
```
## Ignoring Stuff

In package.json, there's an `ignore` array that accepts glob patterns for files and directories:

``` json
{
  ""standard"": {
    ""ignore"": [""/vendor""],
  }
}
```

To ignore a few lines of code, wrap them in these comments:

``` js
/* eslint-disable */
// wild and crazy javascript goes in here!
/* eslint-enable */
```

To ignore a single line of code, use a `// eslint-disable-line` comment:

``` js
 let obj = new (Function.prototype.bind.apply(constructor, [null].concat(args))) // eslint-disable-line
```
## CoffeeScript Legacy

Back in January, the electron codebase was [converted from Coffeescript to JavaScript](https://github.com/atom/electron/pull/4065). This automated refactor left behind a number of code artifacts, some of which have been cleaned up here.

All [implicit returns](http://blog.artillery.com/2014/06/working-with-coffeescript-common-gotchas.html) that were doing assignment have been removed (e.g. `return foo = 1`). There are undoubtedly still lots of unneeded (yet syntactically valid) implicit returns left over.

There's still plenty of leftover cruft from the coffeescript conversion, but most of it is harmless. Any time you see [`ref =`](https://github.com/atom/electron/search?l=javascript&q=ref+%3D&type=Code&utf8=%E2%9C%93) in a javascript file, it's pretty safe to assume that it's old coffee code that could use some cleanup.
## Getting and Setting Prototype

``` js
// old setter
thing.__proto__ = EventEmitter.prototype

// new setter
Object.setPrototypeOf(thing, EventEmitter.prototype)

// old getter
thing.__proto__

// new getter
Object.getPrototypeOf(thing)
```
## Invoking Constructors

It works to leave off the parens, but don't do it:

``` js
// no
new Thing

// yes
new Thing()
```
## Merging this PR

As @paulcbetts [recently observed](https://github.com/electron/electron-api-demos/pull/83#issuecomment-201023170):

> On a more important tip, for older projects, try to get as many PRs as possible merged before you make the conversion, because the rest of the PRs will get rekt by merge conflicts

As of this writing, there are **15 open pull requests**. We should decide which of those we want to land before this refactor, and which we should close or rebase post-standard.

Given the haphazard and compulsively granular commit history in this branch, I'd be happy to squash it all into a single commit if that's preferred by the team.

4897,"If `nodeIntegration` is disabled on the parent window then disable it on all child windows opened via `window.open` or in `<webview>` tags.

This prevents windows without node integration from opening new windows with node integration enabled.

This seems to be an intuitive behavior for this option, if you disable node on a window/webview then all downstream windows will also have node integration disabled preventing content run in those windows from ""breaking out"" and getting access to node integration via calls to `window.open`.

4896,"This PR adds an API enabling Electron to set itself as the default protocol handler for a custom protocol on both OS X and Windows. The API uses the Windows Registry and LSSetDefaultHandlerForURLScheme internally.
### `app.setAsDefaultProtocolClient(protocol)`
- `protocol` String - The name of your protocol, without `://`. If you want your app to handle `electron://` links, call this method with `electron` as the parameter.

This method sets the current executable as the default handler for a protocol (aka URI scheme). It allows you to integrate your app deeper into the operating system. Once registered, all links with `your-protocol://` will be openend with the current executable. The whole link, including protocol, will be passed to your application as a parameter.

On OS X, one can only register protocols that have been added to the app's `info.plist`, which can not be modified at runtime (and is therefore not part of the API). You can however change the file with a simple text editor or script during build time.
### `app.removeAsDefaultProtocolClient(protocol)` _Windows_
- `protocol` String - The name of your protocol, without `://`.

This method checks if the current executable as the default handler for a protocol (aka URI scheme). If so, it will remove the app as the default handler. On OS X, removing the app will automatically remove the app as the default protocol handler.

As I was opening this PR, I realized that the getter property isn't as exact as it should be. We are missing a few things:
- Same-origin policy restriction; in a normal browser, only windows on the same origin can see each others locations. Although, a parent can set a child's URL to whatever it wants
- Object with lots of keys (e.g. `href`, `hostname`). If this is too complex, then we can reduce the PR to a `location` setter

The problem with this is that chromium internally stores the ""image"" of a site in the backing store in ARGB, and we get a converted image ([relevant code](https://code.google.com/p/chromium/codesearch/#chromium/src/content/browser/compositor/delegated_frame_host.cc&l=622)) that we need to process to get an ARGB frame that we can use. This means that the image quality will be worse, and we will be spending time converting to formats that we don't really need. Also, the YV12 format lacks an alpha channel, and we can't restore that when converting back to ARGB.

If we change our code a bit and we only listen to the `ShouldCaptureFrame` calls, and use them as a ""frame is ready"" message, we can use `CopyFromBackingStore` to start a copy of the frame ourselves, and this way we can get an ARGB buffer with all the information that we need. This method uses the same functions (or similar) to get the frame as the implementation of the frame subscriber would. (relevant code parts: [`CopyFromBackingStore`](https://code.google.com/p/chromium/codesearch/#chromium/src/content/browser/renderer_host/render_widget_host_impl.cc&rcl=1456432083&l=779) => [`CopyFromCompositingSurface`](https://code.google.com/p/chromium/codesearch/#chromium/src/content/browser/compositor/delegated_frame_host.cc&rcl=1456403485&l=136), [`AttemptFrameSubscriberCapture`](https://code.google.com/p/chromium/codesearch/#chromium/src/content/browser/compositor/delegated_frame_host.cc&rcl=1456417974&l=336) both uses the `RequestCopyOfOutput`, 'tho the frame subscriber actually tries to be faster by accessing the `Surface` directly, which we could do too, but that complicates the code too much)

This should speed up the frame capture process, and we'll get alpha channel data and clean, non-JPEG edges.

In Atom, we'd like to show electron deprecations in the [Deprecation Cop](https://github.com/atom/deprecation-cop) view. This PR adds the following APIs:

``` js
const deprecations = require('electron').deprecations;
deprecations.setHandler(myHandler);
assert(deprecations.getHandler() === myHandler);

I noticed that there was already a non-enumerable `deprecate` module, used internally by the other modules. I added `deprecations` as a separate module in order to keep the private and internal APIs separate.

This exposes BrowserWindow `scroll-touch-down` and `scroll-touch-up`, which fire immediately when the user touches two fingers to the trackpad, and again when the user lifts their fingers. Combined with the existing wheel event should allow for ""swipe-to-archive"" and other similar interactions.

However the weak callback in Node neuters the handle, and when the weak callback in blink deals with the handle crash will happen. We fix it by not neutering the handle in Node's weak callback, I'm not sure why Node is neutering a Buffer in its weak callback but it should be totally fine, because once the handle is garbage collect there will be no way to access it in JavaScript.

This is not a issue in old versions because Node v4 attached the weak handle to ArrayBufferView, which I think results in Node's weak callback being called after blink's weak callback.

- Now has entire `BrowserWindowProxy` API which includes things like `eval`, `focus`, and `close`.
- `event.source` on `postMessage` events now matches `window.opener`
- `window.opener` no longer has a custom `postMessage` method, it just uses the default `BrowserWindowProxy` implementation.

Previously it appeared like the `guestId` on the `source` object on message events was the id of the target window so I changed it to be the source window id instead which allowed the removal of the `ATOM_SHELL_GUEST_WINDOW_MANAGER_WINDOW_OPENER_POSTMESSAGE` ipc event completely.

This becomes problematic in the scenario where we use
`child_process.execFile` on a Windows Batch script that lives inside the

Windows relies on the extension being present in order to interpret the

1. Create a dummy batch script (test.bat):

1. Create an electron app that attemps to call this script with
   `child_process.execFile`:

var path = require('path');

child_process.execFile(path.join(__dirname, 'test.bat'), function(error, stdout) {

An application like this will fail when being packaged in an `asar` with
an following error:

Electron overrides certain `fs` functions to make them work within an
`asar` package. In the case of `execFile`, the file to be executed is
extracted from the `asar` package into a temporary file and ran from
there.

The problem is that during the extraction, the original permissions of
the file are lost.

We workaround this fact by forcing execution permissions on the
extracted file when overriding `execFile` and `execFileSync`.

> This PR adds support for the `--proxy-bypass-list` command line argument. It enables you to decide on hosts that should bypass the proxy server set by `--proxy-server`. For example if your app talks to a local web server (e.g. http://127.0.0.1:8080), you probably don't want it to go through the proxy server (how will it resolve 127.0.0.1 to the correct host?), so you can use `--proxy-bypass-list=""127.0.0.1:8080""` or the more general `--proxy-bypass-list=""<local>""`.
> The value can contain more than one host, separated by semi-colon. See examples at: https://www.chromium.org/developers/design-documents/network-settings

The `kDisableLegacyIntermediateWindow` Chromium switch seems to be the one disabling it.

I found that this switch is being set in Electron due to an issue in moving and resizing frameless windows. The comment also mentions that the issue could have been been fixed in Chrome 38, which is rather old. The issue seems fixed since after removing the flag I can move and resize frameless windows.

### Proposed API

``` js
import app from 'app';

app.on('ready', () => {
  shouldQuit = app.makeSingleInstance((cmdLine) => {
    // TODO: Handle command line from secondary instance
    return true;
  });

  if (shouldQuit) app.quit(0);
});
```

When apps are invoked as the secondary instance (i.e. an instance is already running), `makeSingleInstance` will send the command-line arguments to the primary instance and exit the app. This means that `makeSingleInstance` should be called as early as possible (i.e. before `ready`), so we'll set it up for that to be possible

2976,"The module system of Node tends to iterate every parent folder of the `require`d module and add everyone of them to search paths, it makes sense for Node, but in Electron this mechanism may happen to override app's modules with unrelated ones when user's system has lots of Node modules installed.

A classic problem is users have third party `dialog` module installed somewhere, resulting in `require('dialog')` calls in app not working.

This PR solves this problem by limiting the propagated paths to be inside the `process.resourcesPath`, so packaged app can avoid accidentally using modules installed in user's machine. And for `require` calls that explicitly use modules outside the app, there will be no limitation, otherwise unexpected behaviors may happen.

Previously when node integration is turned off in the webview or BrowserWindow, the `process` and `global` symbols will not be available in the preload script after the first tick of message loop. This PR takes a work-around by turning those symbols into local variables, so scripts ran by `require` will still have access to them, and the web page won't be able to access them when node integration is off.

The downside is users won't be able to override global symbols in this way any more, since those symbols are local variables now:

I think we should reconsider using a CI for Windows so we can catch issues like this faster. From what I understand the reason it's currently disabled is that building on `appveyor` takes over 30 minutes. `appveyor` states in their FAQ that if you purchase a ""Pro"" or ""Premium"" plan you'll get `dedicated hardware with faster CPUs, SSD drives, 1 GB network uplink`. So maybe we can contact them and see if we can try running the build on the stronger machines.

The issue was that on Windows the close button (the `X` in the dialog's border) was visible only if `cancelId` wasn't 0. This is weird, because it means that no dialog that contains a single button will ever have a close button (e.g. the `alert` dialog). The OS X and Linux implementation doesn't do that. So I changed the Windows code, to always show the close button.

I added two additional small changes:
- Changed `alert` to always return `undefined` instead of 0 (the index of the `OK` button), so it will comply with the spec (or at least how most browsers choose to implement it).
- Explicitly set the `cancelId` for `confirm` to 1. The button on index 1 is `Cancel` and according to the documentation `cancelId` will automatically be set to it in the Windows and OS X implementation. This change makes sure that Linux will use the same `cancelId`.

- In `BrowserWindow` the instance methods were noted as `BrowserWindow.devToolsWebContents` which I feel is a bit misleading since you can't call `devToolsWebContents` _on_ `BroswerWindow` but instead need an instance of it.

- Use `bash` instead of `cmd` (because of syntax highlighter).
- Change doc titles to their object name format (i.e. `browser-window` ‚Üí `BrowserWindow`).
- No headers following headers, add at least one sentence description.
- Methods wrapped in `code` ticks.
- Events wrapped in singe 'quotation' marks.
- No nesting more than 2 deep (unfortunately because of markdown renderer).
- Add section titles Events, Class Methods and Instance Methods.
- Use 'will' over 'would' when describing outcomes.
- Events and methods are `h3`.
- Optional arguments written as `function (required[, optional])`.
- Optional arguments are denoted when called out in list.
- Line length is 80-column wrapped.
- Platform specific methods are noted in italics following method header.

And a few other smaller things like consistent periods in lists, phrasing, specifying 'Returns' for returned values...

Worse yet, since `errorMsg` wasn't an instance of `Error`, any code that assumes this in any `process.on('uncaughtException')` handler would fail. Also, correctly emitting the error provides the stack trace.

2025,"The PR introduces a new type `powerSaveBlocker` API. Fixes #1936 

API details:
# power-save-blocker

The `power-save-blocker` module is used to block the system from entering
low-power(sleep) mode, allowing app to keep system and screen active.

An example is:

``` javascript
var powerSaveBlocker = require('power-save-blocker');

var id = powerSaveBlocker.start(powerSaveBlocker.PREVENT_DISPLAY_SLEEP);
console.log(powerSaveBlocker.isStarted(id));

powerSaveBlocker.stop(id);
```
## powerSaveBlocker.start(type)
- `type` - Power save blocker type
  - powerSaveBlocker.PREVENT_APP_SUSPENSION - Prevent the application from being
    suspended. Keeps system active, but allows screen to be turned off.
    Example use cases: downloading a file, playing audio.
  - powerSaveBlocker.PREVENT_DISPLAY_SLEEP - Prevent the display from going to sleep.
    Keeps system and screen active.
    Example use case: playing video.

Starts the power save blocker preventing the system entering lower-power mode.
Returns an integer identified the power save blocker.

**Note:**
`PREVENT_DISPLAY_SLEEP` has higher precedence level than `PREVENT_APP_SUSPENSION`.
Only the highest precedence type takes effect. In other words, `PREVENT_DISPLAY_SLEEP`
always take precedence over `PREVENT_APP_SUSPENSION`.

For example, an API calling A requests for `PREVENT_APP_SUSPENSION`, and
another calling B requests for `PREVENT_DISPLAY_SLEEP`. `PREVENT_DISPLAY_SLEEP`
will be used until B stops its request. After that, `PREVENT_APP_SUSPENSION` is used.
## powerSaveBlocker.stop(id)
- `id` Integer - The power save blocker id returned by `powerSaveBlocker.start`.

Stops the specified power save blocker.
## powerSaveBlocker.isStarted(id)
- `id` Integer - The power save blocker id returned by `powerSaveBlocker.start`.

Returns whether the corresponding `powerSaveBlocker` starts.

1587,"Using the `setUserAgent` method on WebView when you want to ensure that all requests get sent with your custom user agent is very difficult to get right - if you call it too early, the method throws, and calling it too late will result in the first few requests being sent with the default user agent.

This PR creates an additional way to set the user agent, via an HTML attribute:

```
<webview tabindex=""-1"" id=""webView1"" preload=""myScript.js"" src=""https://google.com"" useragent=""Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; Trident/7.0; AS; rv:11.0) like Gecko"">
</webview>
```

This then guarantees that we'll apply the custom user agent right before navigation. This PR doesn't remove the existing method, nor does it attempt to catch mutations to `useragent` after the page has loaded - I can add these.

In the implementation, Chromium seperates a prcoess called `Utility` to do the printing work, so we need to custom the `Utility` process for Electron. On Windows, the print API relies on the `pdf` component which using to convert to EMF
(see https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=170859). So we need to port `pdf` component in `libchromiumcontent`.

But there are something need to be considered. Introducing `pdf` component will make the release binary size larger. Is this reaonable? Or we can make the `pdf` as a seperated shared library(`dll`), and if developers don't need the print API, they can safely remove it in saving the binary size. 

As a side effect, with `pdf` component, we may easyly support `print to pdf` and `view pdf` features.

1411,"This PR adds extremely basic support for accessibility on OS X using VoiceOver by enabling chromium accessibility when VoiceOver is active.

Previously, any usage of VoiceOver was broken due to a patch to force Text-to-Speech to use Cmd+C to speak the selected text instead of the window title. For users using accessibility, this trapped them in the window with no child accessibility elements, giving an experience something like:
![atom-shell-no-accessibility](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/349190/7106786/00bf5de0-e103-11e4-9a74-61e9544275f1.gif)

This patch is two-fold:
- VoiceOver is detected, and the chromium accessibility feature is enabled and disabled based on this status. A similar approach to that used in Chromium itself is used for this.
- The TTS hack is modified to leave the chromium accessibility tree and the close/minimise/maximise buttons (but not the window title) as children of the window, rather than removing them completely.

The final result is that accessibility implementation on mac is now left up the standard HTML/web content accessibility features:

1389,"When Atom Shell started over two years ago, its one and only consumer was the [Atom](https://github.com/atom/atom) editor.

And so the original Atom Shell name was just a stopgap to refer to the Chromium/Node integration pieces and the native bits for window management and OS integrations such as the clipboard, the dock, etc.

But over the last two years Atom Shell has grown and matured to become a framework that isn't just for building text editors. People are now using it to build email clients, design tools, chat clients, and video players.

It deserves a better name that decouples it from the Atom editor association and allows it to stand on its own and continue to become the easiest way to build native apps using web tech.

So the new name will be :zap: **electron** :zap: and this pull request will update all the places in the code and the docs to this new name.

For Chrome the `file:` is hard-coded on may places to make it a standard protocol while keeping the ability to represent Windows file paths.

Another limitation is there are some security restrictions for custom protocol (#1069), which are unnecessary if the custom protocol already accesses the file system. The `file:` bypasses those security restrictions also by hard-coding the conditions in code.

* `appData`: Per-user application data directory, by default it is pointed to:

  * `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME` or `~/.config` on Linux
  * `~/Library/Application Support` on OS X
* `userData`: The directory for storing your app's configuration files, by

  * `~/Library/Caches` on OS X
* `userCache`: The directory for placing your app's caches, by default it is the
 `cache` directory appended with your app's name
* `temp`: Temporary directory
* `userDesktop`: The current user's Desktop directory
* `exe`: The current executable file
* `module`: The `libchromiumcontent` library

## app.setPath(name, path)

* `name` String
* `path` String

Overrides the `path` to a special directory or file associated with `name`. if
the path specifies a directory that does not exist, the directory will be

You can only override paths of `name`s  defined in `app.getPath`.

- Management of guest webviews are done by pure JavaScript
- Access of `<webview>` is provided by the `WebContents` API of atom-shell that we would have the same API to control web page with `BrowserWindow`, so it is consistent and more powerful

When checking if we should react differently when GlobalMenu bar is used, we should check if `UBUNTU_MENUPROXY` env var is (correctly) set instead of checking if we're using Unity on a Unity session.

It's maybe better to do that because we can use Compiz on a Unity session without Unity. Or we can also use Unity in a different session.

Note that I was not able to test this new code (sorry for that) but when I'm using Atom on Ubuntu with a Cairo-Dock session and Unity is not running, Atom window doesn't have any menu.

A few details about my system:

```
$ echo $DESKTOP_SESSION    
cairo-dock
$ ps aux | grep ""[l]ibappmenu""
$ echo $UBUNTU_MENUPROXY   

$ echo $XDG_CURRENT_DESKTOP

Thank you for developing and maintaining Atom!
I'm using Atom on GNU/Linux Ubuntu and it seems that the launcher is named `Atom.desktop` but the window's class is `Atom Shell` (we can get it via this command: `xprop | grep CLASS`).

The window's class should be `Atom` instead of `Atom Shell` because the launcher and the binary to launch Atom are called 'atom' and not 'atom shell'. This is why currently all Atom's windows will not be linked to their launcher in a dock (e.g. with Cairo-Dock).

Note that it's not advised to add white-spaces in a window's class ('Atom Shell').

I'm going to add a new pull request in `atom` project in order to remove the capital letter in the name of the `.desktop` file (a `.desktop` file should not contain any capital letters in its name).

This is happening because `-Dtarget_arch=ia32` is passed to ninja on linux inside `script/update.py` which leads to '-DARCH=""ia32""' being set in the compile flags. I see that the current intention is to target 64 bit builds on linux (37275c64cd07) and the binaries are in fact compiled as 64 bit despite this bug.  I guess ninja is somehow smartly ignoring the incorrect setting of the `-m32` flags at https://github.com/atom/node/blob/6d772c3cda0bb8270857397e128ea1e36c361125/common.gypi#L175-L178.

231,"### What's native-mate

[native-mate](https://github.com/zcbenz/native-mate) is a fork of Chromium's [gin](https://code.google.com/p/chromium/codesearch#chromium/src/gin/README&sq=package:chromium) library that provides helper classes to write C++<->JavaScript bindings.

I forked gin because it was intrusive which resulted in conflicts with node's `Environment`, and atom-shell also needs to create classes in JavaScript which is not supported by gin.
### What do we get

With the help of Chromium's `base` library, native-mate makes writing JS bindings incredibly easy and beautiful. For example, the original shell module's code:

``` c++
// static
void Shell::OpenItem(const v8::FunctionCallbackInfo<v8::Value>& args) {
  base::FilePath file_path;
  if (!FromV8Arguments(args, &file_path))
    return node::ThrowTypeError(""Bad argument"");

  platform_util::OpenItem(file_path);
}

// static
void Shell::Initialize(v8::Handle<v8::Object> target) {
  NODE_SET_METHOD(target, ""openItem"", OpenItem);
}
```

now becomes:

``` c++
void Initialize(v8::Handle<v8::Object> exports) {
  mate::Dictionary dict(v8::Isolate::GetCurrent(), exports);
  dict.SetMethod(""openItem"", &platform_util::OpenItem);
}
```

The native-mate/gin has hidden most details of converting V8 types between C++ types, and did a very good job of deducing function signatures, for most cases, no raw V8 API is needed to implement an API binding.
