### Background
For extension's content scripts injection, Chromium relies on [""isolated world""](https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/content_scripts#execution-environment).

> Content scripts execute in a special environment called an isolated world. They have access to the DOM of the page they are injected into, but not to any JavaScript variables or functions created by the page. It looks to each content script as if there is no other JavaScript executing on the page it is running on. The same is true in reverse: JavaScript running on the page cannot call any functions or access any variables defined by content scripts.

In Electron, the current implementation relies on [`vm.runInThisContext`](https://github.com/electron/electron/blob/master/lib/renderer/content-scripts-injector.js#L16-L23) that does not have the same isolation properties.

### Objective
This PR wants to add the necessary APIs to deal with isolated world and use it in content scripts injection.

### Exploration
_Picked from #9494_
Here are my findings from diving into [`ScriptInjection`](https://cs.chromium.org/chromium/src/extensions/renderer/script_injection.h?type=cs&sq=package:chromium):
- it relies on `blink::WebFrame#executeScriptInIsolatedWorld`
- however there is no way to pass an existing `V8:Context` to `executeScriptInIsolatedWorld` (I think blink is creating contexts internally). Instead, chromium is hooking into `DidCreateScriptContext` in [` Dispatcher`](https://cs.chromium.org/chromium/src/extensions/renderer/dispatcher.cc?type=cs&sq=package:chromium&l=291) that returns a `V8:Context` freshly created.
- from there and by mapping `world_id` passed in `executeScriptInIsolatedWorld` and returned in `DidCreateScriptContext`, it can manipuate the `V8:Context` to add the necessary `chrome.*` APIs to the context (how exactly?)

### Plan
I think what can be done is:
- add `webFrame.executeJavaScriptInIsolatedWorld(worldId, code, ..)` to the `webFrame` API alongside the existing `webFrame.executeJavaScript`
- have an event `'did-create-script-context'` which callback returns `worldId` and `context` (type of context representing `v8::context`?)
- but how to inject chrome apis in the `context`? Looks like [this](https://github.com/electron/electron/blob/c6918966c25144e85956b8614bd5f005ae4e642a/atom/renderer/atom_renderer_client.cc#L172-L204) can lead to ideas.
- [bonus] add `webFrame.setIsolatedWorldContentSecurityPolicy` and `setIsolatedWorldSecurityOrigin` that could be needed at some point",54,True,en

10136,"Changed from [NSWindow toggleFullScreen:] to [NSView enterFullScreenMode:withOptions:] when enabling kiosk mode since it resolves a lot of kiosk mode related issues such as menu bar, dock and applications on other displays being visible.

Example issues that are solved are: #8426 and #1054

**Special note:** Worth mentioning is that this kiosk mode is so aggressive that it will not even allow dialogs to show - showing dialogs will practically cause the computer to hang, because you will not be able to interact with the application when the dialog is alive, and you cannot interact with the dialog since the application is running in strict full screen.

So this is a decision if it is worth a tighter kiosk mode with the con that dialogs does not work as intended.

9648,"Addresses [Code Signing of ASAR files](https://github.com/electron/asar/issues/123).

* Any application that uses external files as code sources are not protected and code signing doesn't make sense.
* Anyone can use trusted app from trusted vendor as a template for malicious app.
  * macOS: Static validation failed (when you manually check using codesign tool or another tools), dynamic (performed on run for quarantined apps) passed.
  * Windows: no app bundle concept at all, no way to statically check app, no dynamic validation at all. Nothing prevents.
* Java, Electron apps are affected. 

How do we can fix it?

1. Embedding code sources into the executables.
    1.1 Modifying existing executable.
    * macOS: [Not possible](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4022495/how-can-i-add-sections-to-an-existing-os-x-executable).
    * Windows: using windows resources.

     As it is not possible on macOS, this approach is rejected.

    1.2 Linking during build. It will complicate Electron app development. Another approach should be used.

    So, although embedding code sources into the executables approach is the most secured, price is too high. 

2. Really sign ASAR file and verify on ASAR file load. Well, implementation will be complex and fragile (very easy to verify code integrity, but identity validation...). So, this approach is rejected.

3. Keep code integrity data in the application manifest and verify only integrity on ASAR file load. As application manifest is a part of executable file (Windows) and `Info.plist` is a part of application bundle (macOS), we don't need to verify identity and so, our implementation is robust and straightforward. If integrity data will be changed — code signature will be broken and application will be marked as damaged by OS.

Third approach, ""code integrity data in the application manifest"", is implemented in this PR.

Some notes:
* macOS specific: Depending on not yet known reasons even modified Info.plist is not a reason to prevent run on macOS sometimes. Under some conditions app is marked as damaged, but under another conditions not (interestingly, in both cases app is quarantined (`com.apple.quarantine`, can be checked using `xattr` tool)). Well, it doesn't invalidate the whole idea of this PR:
    * small amount of data can be embedded into existing Mach-O object file if will be proven that `Info.plist` is not really secured. So, it can be implemented later if need.
    * static validation is not passed (since code signature will be broken), so, user has ability to verify application using standard tools.
* sha512 is used because [it is faster](https://crypto.stackexchange.com/questions/26336/sha512-faster-than-sha256) than sha256 on x64 machines.
   * 5MB hashed in 4ms, 30MB hashed in 45ms. So, integrity check doesn't slow down app loading.
* macOS specific: Officially [not recommended](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/technotes/tn2206/_index.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/DTS40007919-CH1-TNTAG201) to sign non-Mach-O executables. So, unlikely PR to `electron-osx-sign` will be filed to sign ASAR files.
* Windows is unsecured, even macOS Gatekeeper doesn't work as expected... Should we worry about code integrity if even checks on OS level so insecure? Well... no excuse for us. Integrity check is cheap, build process is not complicated. So, why not to make sure that on our level user is protected and we do our best to protect users?

Checksums stored as JSON object under the key `AsarChecksums`. If key not specified — no integrity check. `electron-builder` (asar is enabled by default) will add integrity data on build (will be implemented as separated npm module to reuse this logic in other build tools).

Implemented for macOS only for now, I want to hear your feedback.

Really deep objects specified as arguments to remote functions currently throw errors because the metadata received gets truncated at the IPC layer and so the format received by `rpc-server.js`  is invalid/incomplete.

This pull request removes this recursion depth completely. This value seemed somewhat arbitrary and was originally inherited from Chrome. Currently we don't limit the size of IPC objects in other ways so this seems okay to do and can be improved upon further via https://github.com/electron/electron/issues/7286.

The other options I can think of here would be:

- Have `remote.js` throw errors when function arguments that will exceed this limit are specified.
- Gracefully handle invalid/incomplete metadata in `rpc-server.js`. This option would seem surprising to developers since large objects they send over would just have `null` fields certain places and would be hard to track the cause.

I noticed this issue while investigating #8423 and trying to send `module` over the remote interface which is pretty nested.

8688,"Fix for #8209.

In situation when there are two windows open, with one being in focus and another one being blurred, if we popup menu for the blurred window, click callbacks for menu items will get either `null` or focused window as second parameter.
That fix passes information about window used in `popup` method with fallback to a focused window.

Note that even though Chrome focuses a blurred window when you right-click on it, I don't think that will be a desired behavior for Electron users. Plus devs can always focus desired window manually. So I didn't modify that ""focusing"" logic.

I had trouble with the test. Apparently if I just use `menu.popup(window)`, the test gets stuck because no code after that line is run before I manually click on the window to close context menu. And I see no way to close it programmatically. So as a workaround I just set `menu.window` property (which should be done by `popup` method) and for that I created a testing-only method `_setWindow`.

n._triggerFile (C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Local\GPMDP_3\app-4.0.1\resources\app.asar\build\renderer\ui\components\settings\FileInput.js:9:1841.

However in production I don't want random webContents crashes or race conditions to throw errors at my users that I can't catch in a sensible way (`process.on('uncaughtException')`) doesn't count....

Greetings,

On line number `131` of [atom_blob_reader.cc](https://github.com/electron/electron/blob/master/atom/browser/atom_blob_reader.cc#L131) we believe there is a memory leak, which is an bug. The reason we should delete is that memory is a finite resource within our running programs. Sure in very short running simple programs, failing to delete memory won't have a noticeable effect. However on long running programs, failing to delete memory means we will be consuming a finite resource without replenishing it. Eventually it will run out and our program will abruptly crash. This is why we must delete memory.

I'm not _that_ familiar with C++, and most of the code I added in `browser_win.cpp` was based on the example set by the existing `SetUserTasks` method. Attempts to refactor shared functionality (the entirety of the for-loop that creates and populates `IShellLink` objects) didn't seem to work, so I would appreciate a second pair of eyes to give me feedback on how that can be done.

This is a first pass, and there are undoubtedly some areas where the parsing needs to be tweaked.

This seemed to me like an appropriate solution to this problem, but it isn't like anything that you are doing currently in electron so if I am doing something crazy, let me know and I won't take offence :)

The basic idea is that this can be used rather than implementing an API like the one for dark mode with every system preference (like the graphite appearance setting) one by one.  This provides a mechanism for letting users create front-ends as separate npm packages like this one: https://github.com/dylan-cooper/electron-osx-prefs while electron is used as the back-end.  Note that it can also be used for things unrelated to the system preferences such as bluetooth turning on/off, new users being added, etc.

The reason that I did this in electron rather than in its own package is because you need an Objective-C runtime to listen to the notifications.  I initially tried with nodobjc, but it didn't work because interfacing the two runtime loops was non-trivial.  I assumed that this would come up if I tried to do this as a separate add-on as well, and the reason this worked was because it was using the chromium run time behind the scenes, but if that will work and this is a bad fit for the electron core, I can give that a shot.

I've stopped here for two reasons. The first is that I wish to seek feedback on the approach of having the `autoUpdater` ask the `app` to emit the normal events rather than having the `autoUpdater` emit them itself. Having the `app` emit them reuses code from the normal quit process, but it is a bit weird to have the `autoUpdater` call what were formerly protected methods.

(Then again, if the `autoUpdater` was to assume the responsibility of emitting the events itself, it would need access to the `app`'s event listeners which would also require sharing protected state.)

The other reason I've stopped here is that I'm not sure how to test further shutdown events. If I let the shutdown process proceed to close the windows, I'll need to be able to reopen the testing window.

I also need to prevent the app from _actually_ quitting because, without an update to install, it won't reopen. (Though that is IMO a bug in `autoUpdater`—it should emit an error (#3840), and I've added a spec to that effect. If I fixed that, then the app would not quit. I'm not sure where to fix that though, in Electron or in Squirrel.)

3337,"Fixes #2715 by implementing IFileOperation (used in Windows Vista forward), replacing SHFileOperation.  This allows us to do a filesystem PreDeleteItem check to ensure the file can actually go into the Recycle Bin.  The existing behavior actually deletes files that cannot be recycled.

Before moving to IFileOperation, I attempted to extend the current implementation by adding the three  checks (Type of Drive, Existence of Recycle Bin on that drive, and free space available in the Bin) with: 

```
INT drive_type = GetDriveType((LPCWSTR)(path_components.at(0) + L""\\"").c_str());
QueryDosDevice((LPCWSTR)path_components.at(0).c_str(), dos_path_chars, 100);
rbinfo.cbSize = sizeof(SHQUERYRBINFO);
SHQueryRecycleBin((LPCWSTR)path.value().c_str(), &rbinfo);
```

But these operations can be extremely slow, especially the SHQueryRecycleBin, which can take seconds to execute, locking the UI in the mean time.  And there are still corner cases where this can fail.

So I move to reimplement with IFileOperation.  It needs a full implementation of the interface IFileOperationProgressSink to be able to check Pre-Delete for the Recycle Bin.  I authored the class implementation inline in platform_util_win.cc and only implemented the minimum methods required for MoveItemToTrash.

It may make sense to actually refactor the IFileOperationProgressSink class externally and use it more generally for other special case file I/O issues on Windows.  SHFileOperation is still faster in execution, but has many limitations in use.

Behavior is now correct.  Files that cannot be recycled will not be deleted and the function will return false.

3218,"Hi,

I recently started using Atom and had some issues with the `Alt` key
toggling menu bar, so I added an option to disable this behavior.

The option can be passed when instanciating a `BrowserWindow`,
or be changed using the `setToggleMenuBarOnAltPressed`method
on a `BrowserWindow` instance.
I also added a `doesToggleMenuBarOnAltPressed` method
to retrieve the current value of the option.
The option is disabled by default, so this will not break or change the behavior of
existing apps.
### Background

In some apps, such as Atom, the menu bar can be restored in other ways,
and as it is not something that is done so often (at least for my usage),
I think this option makes sense.

I will explain my issue in Atom, which is my actual motivation for this option.
I use [XMonad](http://xmonad.org/), and my shortcut to change window focus is `alt+j`.
When I press `alt`, [`menu_bar_alt_pressed` becomes true](https://github.com/atom/electron/blob/master/atom/browser/native_window_views.cc#L864).
Then, when I press `j`, the keydown event is intercepted by XMonad,
and the focus changes to some other app, let's say my browser.
As Atom did not receive the `j` keydown event, `menu_bar_alt_pressed` is still true.
When I then want to go back go Atom, I press `alt+j` again. I usually release the
`j` button instantly, and the `alt` after, so the `j` keyup is not handled by atom, but
the `alt` keyup event is, which makes [the condition for toggling the menu bar](https://github.com/atom/electron/blob/master/atom/browser/native_window_views.cc#L867) true.
So basically each time I change focus to some other app and go back to Atom,
the menu bar is toggled, which is a little annoying.

1960,"Some applications may need to be allowed to make more than the hard-coded limit of 6 connections to a remote host. As an initial patch to get things started, this removes the limit entirely. Though before this is merged upstream I think we should add a JS API or something to allow the caller to override limits on a per-host, or even per-call basis.

To do that, I'll need some help. This is my first endeavor in the electron/atom C++ code. (insert-I-have-no idea-what-I'm-doing-dog.gif) :wink:

As for the JS API, what object do you guys think it would live on? Given the ""browser"" process is responsible for networking (I think), maybe it should go on `app`?

For the actual call:
- we could do something easy like `app.setConnectionLimit(""stream.campfirenow.com"", 100)`. Where maybe passing `-1` would mean unlimited?
- Or something callback-based that was invoked on a per-remote-call basis that has a `url` string passed to it? That way the caller could return a different limit per-host, per-call lazily runtime.

Though, I don't have a strong preference for either one. What do you think?
