Limited testing suggest this solves the recently identified problems and the reason for the old grammar (see https://github.com/github/linguist/issues/3775#issuecomment-322459597) but the only thing I'm not sure about is testing picks up a duplicate for the scope:

3755,"After the discussion in #3560 and following @pchaigno's suggestion in #3559, this PR adds the Solidity language, together with two sample files, but without associating an extension to it.

To sum things up, the associated `.sol` extension is shared by files on GitHub that don't correspond to a language, and it's impossible for a linguist heuristic to return that as a result. This is referred to as the `not-a-language` feature, which is apparently non-trivial to implement. In the meantine, we've agreed on adding the language without an extension, so that repositories can at least use `.gitattributes` overrides to get syntax highlighting.

Here's [a Github search](https://github.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=pragma+solidity&type=Code) for the language with more than 25000 results.

* Conflicts with PR #3559.
* Adds [Solidity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solidity) as a language ([search result](https://github.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=extension%3Asol+%22pragma+solidity%22&type=Code)).
* Changes current vendor of `source.solidity` grammar from [davidhq/SublimeEthereum](https://github.com/davidhq/SublimeEthereum) to [caktux/language-ethereum](https://github.com/caktux/language-ethereum). The latter includes work on the former, and provides a few more grammar files. Language detection for those can be more easily integrated later on, if needed.
* Includes a simple heuristic to differentiate between Eagle soldermask `.sol` files and Solidity, and a test for that. The new Eagle samples are from [storborg/regerberate](https://github.com/storborg/regerberate), which is [MIT-licensed](https://github.com/storborg/regerberate/tree/ed85bb545109950946af90118b058abf9b0bcd3b/samples/eagle).

### Previous attempts

[Sorted chronologically](https://github.com/github/linguist/pulls?q=is%3Apr+solidity+sort%3Acreated-asc):

* PR #2634 - closed as stale, due to possible mis-classification of many non-Solidity files with `.sol` extension;
* PR #3161 - merged manually, proposed [davidhq/SublimeEthereum](https://github.com/davidhq/SublimeEthereum) as `grammar` vendor;
* PR #3522 - closed as unheeding to discussion in PR #2634;
* PR #3559 - currently open, proposes using `.gitattributes` as discussed in PR #2634 and builds directly on top of that (rather old HEAD), resulting in merge conflicts. [Includes example that's licensed under GPLv3](https://github.com/github/linguist/pull/3559#issuecomment-292938301), to the best of my knowledge.

### Outstanding issues

- [x] `TestGrammars` complains that the license for the [caktux/language-ethereum](https://github.com/caktux/language-ethereum) vendor needs to be ""whitelisted"". It is unclear to me whether this action must be performed by a github/linguist maintainer, or can be done by me. The [LICENSE.md](https://github.com/caktux/language-ethereum/blob/master/LICENSE.md) has a non-standard note on inclusion of prior work from [davidhq/SublimeEthereum](https://github.com/davidhq/SublimeEthereum).
- [ ] CI fails due to this (see [relevant build log](https://travis-ci.org/github/linguist/jobs/226368502#L1153)).
- [ ] `master` has drifted since PR opening - will rebase when the above is clarified.
- [x] Heuristic may still mis-classify many files (see [next comment](https://github.com/github/linguist/pull/3560#issuecomment-293001855), or issue #3589).
- [x] Heuristics test ~~missing~~ added.
- [x] A way of indicating `not-a-language` detection ~~is~~ was proposed, but moved to https://github.com/github/linguist/issues/3589#issuecomment-298168908 due to its hackish nature.",195,True,en

It's worth noting that malformed modelines can still change a file's language in Emacs. Provided the `-*-` delimiters are intact, and the mode's name is decipherable, Emacs will set the language _and_ complain about a malformed modeline.

<img src=""https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/2346707/18607443/2230b136-7d10-11e6-95ad-15f0280dc2c9.png"" width=""373"" alt=""# -*- foo-bar mode: ruby -*-"" />

I took this into consideration when rewriting the pattern, sensing that not every user knows or cares if an Emacs modeline isn't being parsed correctly (so long as the correct highlighting is shown).

  I'm not familiar with Bundler or Rake, so I don't know where or how to go about having this script called when `bundle exec rake` is called. Somebody help, please? =)
- **A better preamble for the readme:**  
  I only added it as a placeholder to verify that rerunning the script wouldn't chop it off each time it executed. Feel free to replace the wording with something you feel is more appropriate.

It's a full-blown Turing-complete programming language which just happens to be used primarily for graphical purposes. Wikipedia's entry on [DSLs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-specific_language) even uses PostScript to describe why the term ""Domain-specific language"" can be nebulous:

> For example, Perl was originally developed as a text-processing and glue language, for the same domain as AWK and shell scripts, but was mostly used as a general-purpose programming language later on. **By contrast, PostScript is a Turing complete language, and in principle can be used for any task, but in practice is narrowly used as a page description language.**

## Examples

The sample files were ones I slapped together in 3DS Max earlier this afternoon. I kept them simple to avoid adding too much weight to the repository - OBJ files, like SVGs, can grow very large with too much detail.
## Relevant

I'm aware GitHub supports [3D models](https://github.com/blog/1465-stl-file-viewing), even going as far as [supporting geometry diffs](https://github.com/blog/1633-3d-file-diffs). However, this support is limited to STL files, which're mostly CAD-related. I understand if GitHub don't want to go too crazy with supporting so many different 3D formats, but if there's any format that deserves support in real-time previews, it's definitely OBJ.

I don't know who to ask or where to go to propose adding support for the format on the site. But I can tell you now, there'd be many users who'd appreciate it.

##### Fix test classifier assertion

`Classifier.classify` returns array of array, with each nested array
having exactly two values.The first value is the candidate language
names, which this fix plucks and forms a flat array. Then it asserts
that the intended language name should exist in this flat array.

In this case, `classify()` was returning `[[""YAML"", ""..""], [""JSON"", ""..""]]`
even for `samples/JSON/filename/.eslintrc`, so the current assertion
was failing as it was checking for `result.first[0]`.

## Questions
- What else would be useful?
- This currently uses JavaScript to fetch the latest `languages.yml` from master and build the listing. I'm wondering if `languages.yml` should be copied into the `gh-pages` branch so a static page can be generated for each language. This could be automated so `script/release` copies it to the `gh-pages` branch.

| Type | Increment | Decrement | Square | Output |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Standard Deadfish | i | d | s | o |
| XKCD variation | x | d | k | c |

There aren't a lot of interpreters on GitHub, but [here are some](https://github.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=deadfish).

This is a spike at providing a comprehensive list for which syntax highlight codes are valid on GitHub. I verified a few of the weirder ones manually. For example, something like

``````
``` storyboard

```

``` reek

``````

does actually work:

``` storyboard

``` reek

I wonder also what a test for this might look like, if we wanted one.

I was wondering why [my Spacemacs config](https://github.com/hollingberry/dotfiles/blob/master/emacs/.spacemacs) didn't have syntax highlighting... I think I found the problem.

I modifed the EmacsModeline regexp to allow hyphens in the mode name. This means (I hope) that files with

```
;; -*- mode: emacs-lisp -*-
```

at the top are now correctly recognized as written in Emacs Lisp.

This doesn't solve the problem of more complex modelines like

```

Ragel (the state machine description compiler/language) also supports

1872,"This is an improved reimplementation of #855, something I was hacking on a year ago.

The long and short of it: replace @brianmario / [charlock_holmes](https://github.com/brianmario/charlock_holmes) with a fast, pure Ruby encoding detector for common encodings. It certainly doesn't do all that the ICU library can do — it won't detect legacy multi-byte encodings, Big5, EBCDIC. But it also doesn't have to `dlopen()` a ~25Mb C++ library/module when invoked. And if I had to take a guess, I'd say this probably covers ±99.9% of text files hosted on GitHub.

While I don't have exhaustive benchmarks like last time (@arfon), nor is the module really written as it should be (it currently just monkey patches String), I believe it's at least 50% faster than Charlock (as its used in linguist) and returns far fewer errors, where just about anything that's not UTF-8 gives a  `'split': invalid byte sequence in UTF-8 (ArgumentError)`.

I've put the code for this in a [small gem](https://github.com/geoff-codes/charlotte). The implementation is [here](https://github.com/geoff-codes/charlotte/blob/master/lib/charlotte.rb). Let me know if the comments/code are unclear; I'd be happy elaborate. The repo also has a couple quick and dirty test scripts to compare against charlock and rchardet.

This PR isn't really meant to be merged as is — I've just quickly replaced ""charlock"" with ""charlotte"" to demonstrate. It works as-is, but I think a major refactor of blob_helper.rb, file_blob.rb, etc. would be in order if this idea were to be adopted. So perhaps it's more perhaps an idea for a topic branch?

Also, it would probably be wise to bring `linguist` in line with [github/lib/github/encoding.rb](https://github.com/github/github/blob/master/lib/github/encoding.rb),  [gist/lib/gists/encoding.rb](https://github.com/github/gist/blob/master/lib/gists/encoding.rb),  [gitrpc/lib/gitrpc/encoding.rb](https://github.com/github/gitrpc/blob/master/lib/gitrpc/encoding.rb), and kin.

This adds `disambiguate` to define a new heuristic, passing in the name of the languages to disambiguate, and a block that returns either a definitive language or `nil`.

``` ruby
disambiguate ""Perl"", ""Prolog"" do |data|
  if data.include?(""use strict"")
    Language[""Perl""]
  elsif data.include?("":-"")
    Language[""Prolog""]

The heuristics are tested by calling `assert_heuristics` and passing in a hash of language names and files, which will assert that the given files a detected properly.

``` ruby
  def test_pl_prolog_perl_by_heuristics
    assert_heuristics({

``` ruby

  # Return true or false

This pull request changes `blob_helper.rb` to give a string directly to `Generated.generated?`.
A few tests in `test_blob.test_generated` were relying on the fact that the files to test were not always read.
Thus, I had to add a new samples and remove a few tests:
- I removed the test on `project.pbxproj` because [it doesn't appear to be a XML file](https://github.com/search?q=xml+extension%3A.pbxproj&type=Code&utf8=%E2%9C%93) and I don't know what language it is, so I don't know where to put it.
- I removed the two tests for Godep because the samples would need to be in a `Godeps` folder in order to be detected as generated. This is not currently possible (maybe later with the `test/fixtures/` folder to come).

I'm not sure I did the right thing so I'd very like some more experienced :eyes: on this.

And much more efficient: Invoking `bundle exec linguist FILENAME` on my machine takes 2 (!) seconds (despite my SSD). Invoking it on a dozen files takes about the same time...

This is a very simple hack, and I won't be surprised if you'll want refinements before accepting it (if at all), but it was enough to scratch an itch of mine (namely testing only the .tst files in a big repo, see PR #1523), and I thought perhaps others might benefit from it.

I am not quite happy with it myself; e.g. I think --breakdown should only be accepted once, and as first parameter (but that change would have been incompatible with current behaviour). On the other hand, it should accept any previously valid invocation.

1378,"Hi,

Since shortly after the release of TypeScript, the main Mumble repository (https://github.com/mumble-voip/mumble) has been detected as mostly TypeScript code by linguist. But It's not TypeScript. It's Qt-style C++.

I've gotten tired of seeing that in our repo header, and took a stab at fixing it.

The actual changes I've done are:
- Added `.ts` as a file extension for XML in `languages.yml` (this is in addition to the `.ts` file extension for TypeScript, which is already in the list)
- Copied the Qt translation file at `samples/XML/pt_BR.xml` file to `samples/XML/pt_BR.ts`.
- Ran `bundle exec rake tests`

After doing this, I had an issue where the sample file at `samples/TypeScript/empty.ts` would be misdetected/undetected.

This was because of https://github.com/mkrautz/linguist/compare/fix-qt-ts-detection?expand=1#diff-5565bb45d402d49dbf0d584129df265dL128 - which returns nil for empty files.  I fixed that by removing the empty-check.

Once the empty file was able to be detected as _something_, it would be detected as XML by the classifier (lib/linguist/classifier.rb), causing two tests to fail:

```
test_language(TestBlob) [/home/mkrautz/linguist/test/test_blob.rb:437]:
TypeScript/empty.ts.
<""TypeScript""> expected but was
<""XML"">.
```

This is obviously because the `empty.ts` file in the TypeScript directory was detected as XML by lib/linguist/classifier.rb.

The other failing test was test_classifier.rb:

```
test_classify_ambiguous_languages(TestClassifier) [/home/mkrautz/linguist/test/test_classifier.rb:63]:
/home/mkrautz/linguist/samples/TypeScript/empty.ts
[[""XML"", -4.060443010546419], [""TypeScript"", -5.66988092298052]].
<""TypeScript""> expected but was
<""XML"">.
```

The test_blob.rb failure, I was able to ""fix"" by enabling the heuristic module by:
- Setting ACTIVE to true
- Fixing the `find_by_heuristics` method to correctly return the results of the calls to the `disambiguate_...` methods by making the subsequent `if` statements in `find_by_heuristics` into `elsif`s.

This causes the `samples/TypeScript/empty.ts` file to correctly identified as TypeScript. (At least, I think it makes sense to have an empty .ts file be identified as TypeScript over identifying it as XML -- and the old? heuristics code seems to agree with that thought.)

At this point, the test_classifier.rb failure was still present.  In this changeset, I've silenced the failure by skipping the test if the sample file ends with ""`empty.ts`"".

Now, this is obviously not something you can ship (I think?).  But I'm hoping that this PR can get the ball rolling on getting a cleaner fix. So: take the contents of this PR with a grain of salt. It's just there to get the discussion for a proper fix started, and to better identify (via code/patches) the problems I've faced in ""fixing"" this issue.

I'm happy to implement any suggested fixes, if needed.

This change includes a brief sample program I wrote to illustrate many of Cool's language constructs, as well as a simple rule to distinguish Cool files from Common Lisp or OpenCL (it has a line that starts with the word 'class').

(While it could instead be tucked inside the `linguist` executable with a flag, this seems simpler to me.)

Humorously named, but actually materially quite useful, shell scripts which call `language`.

Aside: I considered putting these in a separate gem, but since they have to be kept in sync with `linguist` and there's not really a documented ""stable API"" per se (not a criticism, doesn't really need one), its honestly just not worth the effort of dependency tracking to put these elsewhere.

I've got a new project that we are migrating to GitHub.  It's currently private while we get approvals from our company to open source it, but we are being incorrectly categorized as Eiffel!

The issue is that we have a very large test suite with our software that stores output in ""ExodusII"" format which is a binary file that has a file extension of "".e"".  I looked over the linguist code and it appears that the binary file checker is not very robust.  I did a little Googling and found a routine that determines the file type based on the actual bytes in the file instead of relying on mime-types or other less reliable methods.

Alternatively, I could propose some other directory names to skip.  We keep all of our tests in a directory named ""tests"" which is not currently in the ""vendor.yml"" file.  When our project goes public, I'll certainly be in touch to show you where our problems are at. 

Disclaimer: I'm not a ruby programmer so if there is a better way to do this test, please feel free to comment.  Have you guys considered allowing projects to put in a .linguist file in their directories to handle project by project configuration?

Thanks,

Added the NetLogo programming language, a dialect of Logo—an adaptation of LISP.
# About

From [Wikipedia:](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logo_%28programming_language%29)

> Logo is a graphic oriented educational programming language, designed in 1967 by Daniel G. Bobrow, Wally Feurzeig, Seymour Papert and Cynthia Solomon. Today the language is remembered mainly for its use of ""turtle graphics"", in which commands for movement and drawing produced line graphics either on screen or with a small robot called a ""turtle"". The language was originally conceived to enable what Papert called ""body-syntonic reasoning"" where students could understand (and predict and reason about) the turtle's motion by imagining what they would do if they were the turtle. There are substantial differences between the many dialects of Logo, and the situation is confused by the regular appearance of turtle graphics programs that mistakenly call themselves Logo.

Source code for the language can be found @NetLogo .

Also added were 3 sample files:
- Ants.nlogo - An simple simulation of ants looking for food
- Life.nlogo - An implementation of Conway's game of life using patches
- Star Fractal.nlogo - A fractal design programmed in NetLogo

More models are available at git@github.com:NetLogo/models.git .
# In the Wild

Logo & NetLogo are very commonly used teaching languages—perhaps one of the most widely used. I have seen many teachers and students store their NetLogo data on github to share.

Netlogo is also often used to create models. Check out a bunch of them here: http://modelingcommons.org/account/login

The scenario commonly arises with C++ headers - a common pattern is to not use a .h extension - Qt has no-extension versions of it's files, and libstdc++ is the canonical example. Some other libraries (like the one I'm working on) also use this pattern.

The solution I'm proposing looks for an editor mode tag comment line in the file, and extracts the mode, which can then be specified as an item in a list for a particular language. Currently implemented are tag searches for vi/vim and for one case of emacs. Others are easily added, I just have no experience with those tags, and the modelines can of course be specified in any language.

I chose to only trigger this search if the normal extension lookup failed, but it could be performed in other scenarios, or all the time, if deemed useful.

287,"I have a peculiar use case for language detection. A few of my Vim plugins are tested using RSpec, which is why I have a lot of ruby code in a `spec` directory. As a result, a lot of ruby code is detected in those projects. For instance, my [switch.vim](https://github.com/AndrewRadev/switch.vim) plugin has, at this time, more ruby code than VimL, which is somewhat misleading. It's completely possible to embed ruby code in VimL, so this kind of a picture could make it seem like the plugin is implemented mostly in ruby, while in reality, it's pure VimL, with ruby specs.

Now, this is _very_ much an edge case, it really wouldn't make much sense to put `spec` in `vendor.yml`. Which is why I implemented per-repo vendoring using a `linguist_vendor.yml` file in the repo itself. I can put a file like that and it will tell linguist to ignore the `spec` dir in this specific project.

I'm not really sure how good of an idea this is -- maybe someone could abuse the system this way? I don't feel there's much of a risk though and it might improve the classification of code on github. Of course, feel free to reject this if you think otherwise.

The implementation extracts some logic in a new class. I could have made it without the addition of a class, but to me, once per-repo vendoring is added, it gets complex enough to devote a separate object that takes care of the logic. If you have a different idea for how the code could look, let me know and I'll see what I can do.

Another thing I'd like to do is have the file be hidden -- `.linguist_vendor.yml` -- but the current code seems to ignore hidden files. It shouldn't be difficult to change this, but it will change the behaviour a bit, so I wanted to ask first.

TeX is already present though I've added the lexer/type/aliases to the entry in the languages.yml. I also made sure that generated TeX files are ignored (by adding some ignore file extensions for the generated files). In addition, I have added some test cases for the ignored generated files as well as commenting them.

39,"TeX was already a language that has syntax highlighting, but I noticed it I was never able to see the percentage of TeX in a repository. So I added TeX as a programming language and made sure that user-made TeX files are counted (by adding some ignore file extensions for the generated files).

Add:
- type, lexer, aliases to TeX in the list of languages
- TeX language test for the latex alias
- Set of generated TeX files to be ignored

Groff:
  extensions:

is causing the error (Extension is missing a '.': 0.1) at https://github.com/christophermanning/linguist/blob/master/lib/linguist/language.rb#L47 since the YAML parser will cast .1, .2, etc. to a float.

```

The wildcards in the lexers.yml for filenames are causing the failure since the line isn't quoted. Quoting the aliases solves the issue.

Also, due to entries without a mimetype or a filename like

```
- !ruby/struct:Linguist::Lexer
  name: Protocol Buffer
  aliases: !ruby/array
  - protobuf
  filenames: !ruby/array
  - ""*.proto""
  mimetypes: !ruby/array
```

the mimetimes will be null so https://github.com/github/linguist/blob/master/lib/linguist/lexer.rb#L152  fails. (/home/c/linguist/lib/linguist/lexer.rb:152:in `block in <class:Lexer>': undefined method`each' for nil:NilClass (NoMethodError)
)

/bin/pygments-lexers now sets empty filenames/aliases/mimetypes to an empty array:

mimetypes: !ruby/array
  []

18,"Hi, 

This pull request adds puppet as a language and uses the ruby lexer to handle it's code. The puppet docs are rendered using ruby syntax rules and it seems to work pretty well.

I wrote tests for the new language and the linguist tool correctly handled a few puppet repositories I have locally. Please let me know if there are any issues.

Thanks,
Dave
