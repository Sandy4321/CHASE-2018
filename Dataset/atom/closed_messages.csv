16127,"### Description of the Change
We have a modal with elements (1) text box, (2) text box, (3) cancel button, and (4) clone button, respectively, from the top-left to the bottom-right.
<img width=""608"" alt=""screen shot 2017-11-08 at 12 43 16 am"" src=""https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6532060/32539885-c2282eba-c41f-11e7-841f-891925c8eb27.png"">

For this modal element, the tabIndexes are -1, -1, 3, 4, respectively. This causes the tabbing order to be (1) > (3) > (4) or (2) > (3) > (4), and then looping forever between (3) and (4), because tabIndex=-1 signifies to skip tabbing for that element. It would appear the root cause is the tabIndex for those elements is hardcoded to be -1. We should probably change that.

Instead, allow a tabIndex to be inferred from the constructor. Now the modal has tabIndexes of 1, 2, 3, 4, as it was intended to be, from the atom github repo.

But now there is a new issue. We can only tab from (1) > (2), but never to (3) or (4). I have tried to understand why this is happening, but I can't come to a conclusion after playing around with the values, nor do I understand how to debug tabbing better than the trial and error approach I have now. Seems like something that's probably better for another ticket, because the tabIndexes are correct now.

### Alternate Designs
Maybe instead of inferring tabIndex from `this.props.element.tabIndex` in line 173, we should instead have some kind of explicit field to specify it, like `this.props.tabIndex`. I would not be opposed to that. Of course, then we need to do some more refactoring work to make tabIndex work for all objects that create this modal. It's a tradeoff between time investment and tech debt.

Also, I'm not sure if this would break other things. Seems like a pretty broad change.

### Why Should This Be In Core?
The core issue here is that the tabIndex is being overwritten in `text-editor-component.js` from a hardcoded value. Even if another package (in this case, the Github package) specifies a tabIndex, it will be squashed by what's hardcoded, and that seems wrong.

### Benefits
You can tab through your text boxes now.

### Possible Drawbacks
You can't tab through your buttons now. I think you also can't use the escape button to exit out of a modal, but you couldn't do that anyways unless the focus was on the ""Cancel"" button, so the problems are linked.

I think the tabbing thing is actually a separate issue, and this PR just solves the tabIndex being squashed by a hardcoded value.

15996,"A more thorough attempt to fix #14909.

Decisions made:

1. Split file/io out from Config class in order to theoretically make testing simpler and allow in the future one of the processes to have changes marshaled across without going to file system. Unfortunately existing tests are more integration tests than unit tests so may need to merge classes back together.

2. Lockfile dependency. Linux doesn't have exclusive locking so we have to use a lock file. This seemed the most popular library.

3. Capture changes and replay them. Borrowed from existing Config class pendingoperations but changed it from function call capture to text so that they could be replayed over process boundaries in the future.

4. Load before save. If the file was locked it's because another process was saving. If we don't reload there's a chance changes will be lost depending on whether we got to handling the file change notification or not yet.

5. Manual debounce & retry. Removed existing debounce code because I need to re-fire the event if an error occurs during save (such as not getting the lock file or some other IO error).

6. Lock file recovery. After 8 attempts if the lock file is still there it might be left over from a crash or something. Rather than silently fail we present an error message with both a 'Retry' button and a 'Force' button - the latter will forcefully remove the lock file so we can continue.

7. Async io. We're trying to move away from sync blocking operations in general and now with extra logic in here it made sense to go async with callbacks.

Issues remaining:

1. What to do when file is locked and we're trying to save on exit?
2. What to do when load fails for any reason and it was requested by file change notification?
3. Current specs for config.cson are not unit tests but integration tests - e.g. setting a value and making sure it saves to disk.  Looks like a big effort to split them out. Alternative is to merge configstorage back into config class.",16,True,en

### Description of the Change

For unknown reasons, `path.normalize` will add a period to the end of a standalone drive letter when normalizing it.  This results in a path such as `C:.`, which, while accepted in Windows Explorer, is treated as `.` by other programs such as Powershell and `path.basename`.  This PR manually fixes the path normalization when the path is _only_ a drive letter on Windows.

### Alternate Designs

Ideally, this should be fixed upstream in Node.

### Why Should This Be In Core?

Because this is a part of the fundamental `atom.project.setPaths` API.

### Benefits

Tree View, with a few additional fixes, should function correctly when being set to a root drive path.

- Check `core.gitRepositoryRefreshOnWindowFocus` in focus handler
- Remove `refreshOnWindowFocus` param since it was unused
- Document the `project` and `config` params

### Description of the Change

If the user has one or more projects in the tree view with Git repositories, Atom freezes for a few seconds each time the window gains focus. The editor spends this time re-indexing Git data for all of those projects in the foreground. This makes Atom feel sluggish and unresponsive, and disrupts work flow when the user is likely to be ready to blaze ahead with an active task.

See #9544 for full discussion of the issue.

After this change, the default behavior is to no longer do this re-indexing work on window focus. A new settings checkbox can be used to enable the old behavior:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1559108/29900065-d6f52a24-8db4-11e7-9b7b-398a5d375f8b.png)

### Alternate Designs

The old code had an unused Boolean parameter controlling whether the focus handler would be wired up. We could have passed the new setting as the value of that parameter. I decided that wasn't desirable because the changes could not take effect immediately when the user changed the setting. To respond to user setting changes on the fly, we need to wire up the event unconditionally and check the setting's current value when it fires. Since the old parameter would conflict with the new setting, it is removed.

### Why Should This Be In Core?

Fixes an issue with Core.

### Benefits

- Improved responsiveness when multitasking Atom with other applications
- Multiple users on #9544 reported quitting Atom or almost quitting due to this issue, so possible improvement in user outreach and retention
- Multiple users on #9544 resorted to risky workarounds (deleting or renaming a project's .git folder, deactivating core packages, avoiding the use of project folders), so possible improvement in general stability if those workarounds are no longer needed

### Possible Drawbacks

The old code does not document why this behavior existed, so we do not know the exact rationale for it or what might be lost by removing it. I speculate that it is to account for the possibility that the user might make changes affecting one of Atom's currently open Git repositories in an external application, which would then need to be reflected in Atom. However, this behavior imposes a serious usability penalty for all Git users, and users who do not need it have no recourse to eliminate this penalty. Furthermore, it is not a robust solution to that potential problem, as it is possible to modify a Git repo without switching focus away from Atom (for example, via a scheduled task or a remote login from another computer).

To mitigate the possibility of new issues, the problematic code is not simply removed. Rather, a setting is created so that users who need the old behavior and are willing to tolerate its drawbacks can enable it with a checkbox in the Core settings.

It tries to mirror 1:1 what the debian pipeline is doing, using the same binaries. So __this should _not_ add additional burden to the Atom team__. It is merely a self-mounting filesystem image. Think of it as putting the contents of the deb into a self-mounting ISO.

Providing an [AppImage](http://appimage.org/) would have, among others, these advantages:
- Applications packaged as an AppImage can run on many distributions (including Ubuntu, Fedora, openSUSE, CentOS, elementaryOS, Linux Mint, and others)
- One app = one file = super simple for users: just download one AppImage file, [make it executable](http://discourse.appimage.org/t/how-to-make-an-appimage-executable/80), and run
- No unpacking or installation necessary
- No root needed
- No system libraries changed
- Works out of the box, no installation of runtimes needed
- Optional desktop integration with `appimaged`
- Optional binary delta updates, e.g., for continuous builds (only download the binary diff) using AppImageUpdate
- Can optionally GPG2-sign your AppImages (inside the file)
- Works on Live ISOs
- Can use the same AppImages when dual-booting multiple distributions

When you try to save a new file (Save an item without a uri), the save as dialog will open in a default OS dependent directory. For example, on Windows it opens in the working directory. But if you have a project open, it makes more sense to open it in the project root folder.

### Benefits

When you save a new file, the save as dialog will start in the project folder.

### Possible Drawbacks

I think that if you pass a `defaultPath` to `dialog.showSaveDialog` than it takes precedence over the OS remembering the last directory used in the dialog.

### Alternate Designs

It might be possible to do the same thing at the client side of BufferedProcess, but BufferedProcess is already doing it on Windows platform as you can see in BufferedProcess.killOnWindows(). That's the reason why I added killOnNix() to BufferedProcess.
<!-- Explain what other alternates were considered and why the proposed version was selected -->

### Why Should This Be In Core?

BufferedProcess is already doing the same thing on Windows platform, therefore it'll be better to have the same functionality on *nix platforms

### Benefits

We don't have to use Terminal or Task Manager to check if a grand-child process is still running or not.
<!-- What benefits will be realized by the code change? -->

### Possible Drawbacks

Whenever Atom calls BufferedProcess.kill(), it'll spawn 'pkill' to kill all possible child processes.  But, anyway, Atom already do the same thing by running 'wmic' :)

I commented out the ""Dependancy Status"" in the README.md, because in current time, the dependency status hosted on https://david-dm.org/atom/atom, is giving a 502 Bad Gateway error. I chose to comment out, and not delete because the website could be fixed in the near future.

No other alternatives were considered, as a search in ""Issues"" of ""Error 502"" takes nothing up. An alternative to this choice would be to delete the code, but that would stop the potential for a fix when the website does get fixed.

Since #13880 the height of a block decorations doesn't get recalculated anymore if the content changes. This brings back the behavior of Atom 1.18. For more information on how to reproduce and GIFs see #14836

This fixes a :bug: 😄 

### Benefits

This makes block decoration rendering consistent with the way it was in Atom 1.18

14720,"### Description of the Change

Right now `atom.commands.dispatch` returns true/false to tell whether a dispatched command exists.

This would return an array of information for the executed commands including the `currentTarget`, `dispatchEvent`, and return value of the command.

This will allow the dispatcher to view the information for each listener of the command. 

### Alternate Designs

I was going to return a `Promise` with `Promise.all()` but I thought this would be better for a couple reasons.

 - `Promise.all()` will reject if only 1 `Promise` fails and the rest of the listeners info will be lost.
 - `Promise.all()` will only let us get the return value of each listener.

To keep backwards compatibility I return false if there are no matches. We could change that in the future.

### Why Should This Be In Core?

This requires changes to the command registry in core.

### Benefits

- Ability to get a return value from a command.
- Ability to tell when an async command actually finishes.
- Ability to dispatch commands in series.

14456,"### Description of the Change
This PR addresses [#9544](https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/9544). The issue here is that upon gaining focus, Atom spins off a new task to update the repository status. Profiling Atom during this time shows that there is a lengthy (~ 2 seconds on my machine, longer on others') delay on the rendering thread due to the `child_process.fork()`. This PR changes it so that ~~each repository has its own~~ **there is a single** long running task that receives a message upon needing to update repo status. This moves the overhead of the `child_process.fork()` into a single hit ~~per repo~~ (I am experiencing zero noticeable delay upon focus now).

### Alternate Designs
~~An alternate design would be to have a single task that handled messages for _all_ repositories. I didn't go this route as I didn't want to change the method signatures in the areas I touched. If we did it at the workspace level, we would need to allow for passing in a reference to the task. And potentially add a few `.destroy()` methods to the layer that housed the task. I figure that it would be rare to have a number of repositories open at any given time that would cause negative effects due to the number of helper tasks alive.~~

**I managed to implement the alternate design without making a change to the API**

### Why Should This Be In Core?
This fixes an issue within core itself.

### Benefits
Usability of Atom is increased as you spend less time per day waiting on a blocked rendering thread.

### Possible Drawbacks
~~If you have a high number of repos open on Atom, you will have a high number of child processes.~~

### Description of the Change

This should fix some regression introduced by commit https://github.com/atom/atom/commit/c6cae5b8fdfea982084b068a0b38a7c988c52f51 related to `showSaveDialog` causing things such ""Save As"", ""Save as HTML"" to not work properly (default filename ""Untitled"" and default path missing when it should be autofilled with more ""reasonable"" ones--e.g. original filename and path). 

This commit fixes the erroneous usage in [`src/main-process/atom-window.coffee#L268`](https://github.com/atom/atom/blob/c6cae5b8fdfea982084b068a0b38a7c988c52f51/src/main-process/atom-window.coffee#L268) introduced in commit https://github.com/atom/atom/commit/c6cae5b8fdfea982084b068a0b38a7c988c52f51
```coffeescript
dialog.showSaveDialog(this, params)
```

Here, `this` refers to an instance of AtomWindow, when the function `dialog.showSaveDialog` requires the first argument to be a BrowserWindow [`electron/lib/browser/api/dialog.js#L24`](https://github.com/electron/electron/blob/master/lib/browser/api/dialog.js#L24). 

So I believe the fix is simply 
```coffeescript
dialog.showSaveDialog(@browserWindow, params)
```

This is consistent with with the function binding usage in [`src/main-process/atom-window.coffee#L86@c6cae5b`](https://github.com/atom/atom/blob/c6cae5b8fdfea982084b068a0b38a7c988c52f51/src/main-process/atom-window.coffee#L86) and with the **old** working function `showSaveDialog` in [`src/application-delegate.coffee#L158`](https://github.com/atom/atom/blob/ae9d949ee4e199d1884bed89083196fa375bbd34/src/application-delegate.coffee#L158)

If we get a textmate theme (e.g. https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JetBrains/colorSchemeTool/master/tmThemes/Monokai.tmTheme).

And try to convert it to an atom theme using apm as shown in the docs:
http://flight-manual.atom.io/hacking-atom/sections/converting-from-textmate/

The resulting theme (if we chose it as the current syntax theme on settings) will display a deprecation warning about two class selectors:

> Starting from Atom v1.13.0, the contents of atom-text-editor elements are no longer encapsulated within a shadow DOM boundary. This means you should stop using :host and ::shadow pseudo-selectors, and prepend all your syntax selectors with syntax--. To prevent breakage with existing style sheets, Atom will automatically upgrade the following selectors:
> 
> atom-text-editor .search-results .marker .region => atom-text-editor .search-results .syntax--marker .region
> atom-text-editor .search-results .marker.current-result .region => atom-text-editor .search-results .syntax--marker.current-result .region
> Automatic translation of selectors will be removed in a few release cycles to minimize startup time. Please, make sure to upgrade the above selectors as soon as possible.

#### Screenshot of the deprecation message
![deprecation-screenshot](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/2272928/23588842/6b95c996-0191-11e7-8ae4-39089d9dbd91.png)

If we look at the base template theme on apm, it's using the `.marker` selector (https://github.com/atom/apm/blob/master/templates/theme/styles/base.less#L54) and when the shadow rules were removed from apm, `.marker` was not prepended with `.syntax--` (https://github.com/atom/apm/pull/615/files).

So, assuming that apm is actually converting the themes correctly, my guess is that `marker` is not a deprecated selector and should be excluded from the warning messages.

Note: Based this pr on https://github.com/atom/atom/commit/abef1f25f9101183c7b73eaaf22ea872dd815c3a

### Alternate Designs

None.

### Why Should This Be In Core?

All themes that are automatically converted with the official atom ""way"" (using apm) are currently displaying deprecation warnings and also triggering some unnecessary automatic selector translations.

### Benefits

See previous item.

### Possible Drawbacks

I personally don't know much about the internals of atom. So, the `marked` selector could possibly be deprecated and the solution could lie elsewhere (e.g. on apm).

I also didn't test this fix at all locally (i didn't find instructions on how to run atom from source, etc). Just traced the deprecation warning message on the source code to this line https://github.com/atom/atom/blob/master/src/style-manager.js#L302, which in turn seem to depend on this other one https://github.com/atom/atom/blob/master/src/style-manager.js#L275 and from the deprecation message, the only class on the selector that i found blacklisted was `marker`.

### Applicable Issues

None that i could find both here and on the apm repo.

* Linux 64-bit machine

### Description of the Change

This PR, when merged, will compile this application on [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/) upon each `git push`, and upload an [AppImage](http://appimage.org/) to a temporary download URL on transfer.sh (available for 14 days). The download URL is toward the end of each Travis CI build log of each build. __Please note:__ Instead of storing AppImage builds temporarily for 14 days each on transfer.sh, you could use GitHub Releases to store the binaries permanently. In this case, delete [this line](https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/13921/files#diff-354f30a63fb0907d4ad57269548329e3R33) from the `.travis.yml` file.

### Alternate Designs

* Flatpak: Requires the setup of Flatpak and a runtime first, need to use the command line. Does not work out-of-the-box on most distributions but Fedora. Does not run on Live CDs.
* Snap: Canonical centric solution, Requires the setup of Snap and a runtime first, does not work out-of-the-box on most distributions but Ubuntu.

### Why Should This Be In Core?

Linux should be a first-class desktop for Atom, and using Atom on Linux should be as easy as on Windows and macOS.

### Benefits

Providing an [AppImage](http://appimage.org/) would have, among others, these advantages:
- Works for most Linux distributions (including Ubuntu, Fedora, openSUSE, CentOS, elementaryOS, Linux Mint, and others)
- One app = one file = super simple for users: just download one AppImage file, [make it executable](http://discourse.appimage.org/t/how-to-make-an-appimage-executable/80), and run
- No unpacking or installation necessary
- No root needed
- No system libraries changed
- Just one format for all major distributions
- Works out of the box, no installation of runtimes needed
- Optional desktop integration with `appimaged`
- Optional binary delta updates, e.g., for continuous builds (only download the binary diff) using AppImageUpdate
- Can optionally GPG2-sign your AppImages (inside the file)

[Here is an overview](https://github.com/probonopd/AppImageKit/wiki/AppImages) of projects that are already distributing upstream-provided, official AppImages.

### Possible Drawbacks

None. Providing an AppImage could be done in addition to providing other types of Linux packages and/or bundles.

13833,"⚠️  Not sure if we should do this ⚠️ 

Since we introduced the `DOMElementPool`, Chrome has [made some improvements](https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/master/third_party/WebKit/Source/platform/heap/BlinkGCAPIReference.md) to its garbage collection of DOM nodes. With those improvements, storing DOM elements in an object pool does not provide the same performance benefits that it once did. This PR removes the `DOMElementPool` and replaces its usages with simple calls to `document.createElement` and `HTMLElement.remove`.

#### Results

I compared the experiences of scrolling for 4 seconds straight in a large file with syntax highlighting (`text-editor-component-spec.js`) before and after removing the element pool. I could discern a difference in the average frame rate or its variance from the timelines.

Looking at the statistics though, it looks like the CPU stays idle for a slightly higher percent of the time **with** the `DOMElementPool`. And as you would expect, the memory usage is slightly more stable with the pool.

**With element pool**

#### Conclusion

Overall, the pool does improve performance very slightly (maybe imperceptibly).

@nathansobo @as-cii @kuychaco In a way, the element pool is still a good idea, but if we keep it, we need to understand that bug that we saw in the line number rendering. What do you think?

13613,"### Description of the Change

Currently atom creates two buffers for the same file if passed paths use difference case for disk drive letter, e.g. `d:\file.txt` and `D:\file.txt`

This change ensures that the absolute path always has disk drive letter in uppercase. 

### Alternate Designs

The other place where this fix could be applied is [findBufferForPath](https://github.com/atom/atom/blob/master/src/project.coffee#L331) function. However the used function [resolvePath](https://github.com/atom/atom/blob/master/src/project.coffee#L229) already has some path normalization code, so I think this is the best fit.

Actually Windows interpreters `file.txt` and `File.txt` as the same file. Maybe it makes sense to extend this patch and make Atom to do the same on this operation system, but I'm not sure because it can be file system specific. Any suggestions are welcome!

### Why Should This Be In Core?

I believe the current behavior of the editor is wrong for Windows users, so it makes no sense to create a plugin to fix that.

### Benefits

The main benefit I would like to get is the ability to click on parsed backtrace in my terminal emulation app (ConEmu). Right now it works, but atom opens second buffer for the same file because it doesn't normalize disk drive letter.

### Possible Drawbacks

The possible drawback is some broken tests, but I've checked that and it seems everything works.

I changed the Github Issues Template so that the numbered list uses repeating `1.` instead of incrementing numeric values.

### Alternate Designs

The current numbering scheme could still be used, but ... see *Benefits* for why I prefer not.

### Why Should This Be In Core?

This is the code repo that this specific Issues Template is used for.

### Benefits

I found that it is much easier to edit a numbered list in any Markdown document that uses repeating numbering instead of incremental numbers that represent the actual numbering that is rendered. It is much easier to add and remove any list element if repeated numbering is used. I only have to focus on the element's content and not the position that it appears in the list. Otherwise, I would have to also manually edit the numbers for any element that appears after the added/removed element. The numbering applied in the raw Markdown is ignored by the HTML renderer anyway, since it will be converted to HTML `<ol><li>`.

### Possible Drawbacks

The repeated numbering may be confusing for those less familiar with Markdown than if reading the raw Markdown code with incremental numbering. However, I would argue that the learning curve to understand how repeated numbering will be rendered is quite minimal. Markdown has become a universal documentation standard in the software world anyways.

### Applicable Issues

Atom linked the exception with the issue #6831, but I don't think this issue is related.",138,True,en
13398,"Electron has an issue where displaying the context menu pauses the rendering loop. https://github.com/electron/electron/issues/1854

One unfortunate side effect is that when you right click on an element, the dom mutations to highlight the element have not been flushed yet which makes for a very bad user experience https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/2991

In order to solve this issue, we would like to flush the mutations and only then display the menu. Unfortunately, electron doesn't have APIs for that.

Things I have tried:
1) Electron has `browserWindow.webContents.invalidate()` and `.on('paint' -> ...)` but it only works with offscreen rendering which     atom doesn't use.
2) `.capturePage(-> ...)` takes a screenshot of the page and I hoped it     would do a flush first but it inconsistently displays the highlight     so it won't work.
3) `Using setTimeout((-> ...), 16)` works many times but not always
4) `requestAnimationFrame(-> ...)` should be what we want but unfortunately     it doesn't always show the highlights :(

What I found worked was to nest three `requestAnimationFrame`, it works all the time even when my machine is busy. This is not a 100% solution but I think that it's okay to assume that if the highlight hasn't been updated in three frames then you should probably try and optimize your code. 3 frames is 50ms and that delay isn't noticeable.

Note: the proper way to solve this that was mentioned in the issue is to open the menu from the main process but this is already what atom does and it's still an issue.

13293,"This PR adds support for building a [flatpak](http://flatpak.org/) for atom. See the feature request issue https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/11837

First time contributing, so please let me know if there is anything else I should do to get this in ship shape. I did not see any tests for other packaging scripts (e.g. create-debian-package.js) so I did not add any here.

A broader conversation should probably happen around how the library dependencies for the app are included. The build script here will try to download an electron ""base application"" which contains things like gtk and libnotify which are needed by any electron app.

This base app can grow with new dependencies of the electron project and contain bug fixes specific to electron. It allows anyone shipping an electron flatpak to avoid library quirks on different linux distributions. It does need to be hosted somewhere though.

For now, the flatpak recipe for building the electron base app is here
https://github.com/endlessm/electron-flatpak-base-app
and my company [endless computers](https://endlessm.com/) is hosting a compiled version of the base app on s3 here
https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/electron-flatpak.endlessm.com/electron-base-app-master.flatpakref

If there is interest, it would be fantastic if atom/electron project could be the official home of the electron base app going forward. We'd be happy to transfer the github repository and help with setting up a place to host the compiled version of the electron base application. Please ping me to discuss further. I can open a follow up issue in the electron repository if that is best.

On a related note, have started work on some [node tools for building electron flatpaks](https://www.npmjs.com/~endlessm), and have a few [other](https://github.com/mattdangerw/webtorrent-desktop/tree/flatpak) [app](https://github.com/mattdangerw/brave-browser-laptop/tree/flatpak) [ports](https://github.com/mattdangerw/Ghost-Desktop/tree/flatpak) in progress.

#### Building
Requires [flatpak > `0.6.13` installed](http://flatpak.org/getting.html). Then just
```
./script/build --create-flatpak
```

#### Testing
Install the flatpak and run it with
```
flatpak install --user --bundle out/atom-x86_64.flatpak

13087,"Currently, the Atom transpilation story, via the compile cache, is as follows:
- All TypeScript (`.ts`) files are compiled with the TypeScript compiler.
- All CoffeeScript (`.coffee`) files are compiled with the CoffeeScript compiler.
- JavaScript (`.js`) files are compiled with the Babel compiler _if_ they start with `/** @babel */`, `""use babel""`, `'use babel'`, or `/* @flow */`. Atom currently uses Babel 5 to transpile JS, and sets some explicit options in `static/babelrc.json`.

In addition, the `ThemeManager` uses `LessCompileCache` to compile Less (`.less`) files to CSS.

In an ideal world, individual packages would have more control over how exactly their source is transpiled before being run in Atom. A best case scenario would be that a package author can specify _exactly_ how we should transform their source. At a minimum, packages should be able to pick-and-choose which JavaScript transformations are applied to them by specifying their own options in a local `.babelrc` and including any additional Babel plugins as appropriate.

To start with, I'm updating Babel to version 6 while attempting to keep the resulting JavaScript as similar to the Babel 5 version as possible, to avoid breaking existing packages.
- [x] Update to Babel 6
  - [ ] Include appropriate plugins to mimic Babel 5 behavior
- [ ] Figure out backward-compat opt-out story (e.g. pragma)
- [ ] Figure out local customizations (including ones with package-specific options, like Relay schema location)
- [ ] Other stuff

As of now all actions after click on close icon happens synchronously - control not returned to browser, so it has no ability to do paint. Solution make reflow actions in asynchronous way so browser would be able to do paints.

As example we can do something like (`tab-bar-view.coffee`):

``` coffeescript
 onClick: (event) ->
    return unless matches(event.target, "".tab .close-icon"")

    tab = closest(event.target, '.tab')
    @setActiveTab(tab) if tab.item.isModified?()
    setImmediate => @pane.destroyItem(tab.item)
    false
```

which will allow browser to do paints

## Benefits:

Be able to hide the title bar leaves more room for the editor and looks less cluttered. Also a package like the tool-bar could use the title bar's place instead.

## Motivation

Currently we load Bootstrap and then try to override it in core. Moving some of it into its own package allows more control and adjustments can be made directly. Also, making changes in a separate package feels less intimidating and can easier be rolled back in `package.json`.
## Concerns

What happens if you disable the UI package?

![ui](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/378023/15624689/ea3cc9c0-24c9-11e6-97cc-2e03d430279e.gif)

Because the main layout styles are still in core and themes override a lot of the components, it doesn't look too broken. Just a few things seem off or un-styled. For the tree-view or nav in the settings, we could remove the list styles in those packages to make a bit more robust. Being able to disable the UI package might inspire the community to create their own version or add additional components.

Some styles got removed, so there is a chance that something might look unstyled or off. Packages bundled with Atom should be fine, but it's hard to predict if community packages rely on any of the removed styles. Maybe in the Beta phase we can catch some regressions.

There is no button bound to 'editor:delete-line' which is an extremely commonly needed action in programming.
core:cut is a very poor replacement for delete-line, because it overwrites the clipboard which may have something useful in it, with something that's useless and the user is trying to discard.

Thus 'shift-delete': 'editor:delete-line' should be the default keybinding in my opinion.

This commit checks the special case of clicking below the buffer and returns the position without going into the whole calculation loop. I'm not super familiar with how the internals of Atom work, and I assumed going through all this calculation to find the very last cursor position was needed due to surrogate pairs or something. But it seems that's not the case as the last column position can be found by just summing the row's textNode lengths, so short circuiting that logic brings a perf win.

This stops freezing for clicking below long lines, but doesn't solve the whole perf problem with seeking long lines. If you were to scroll to the end of a long line and click somewhere close to the end, it will still hang. Perhaps you could calculate the position backwards if the click position is in the latter half of the long line? Either way, that's a discussion for another issue/PR.

As far as tests go, I'm not really sure how you run the line-yardstick specs? Running `script/test` had a lot of failures on master for other specs. I don't think any new specs for line-yardstick is required since it already covers testing clicking below the buffer.

Currently packages (like `tree-view`) manually call out to the filesystem APIs to create files, and other packages aren't notified of such changes.

## Questions
1. **Selector**? Currently uses `.checkbox[type=""checkbox""]`, which means you need to use an `<input type=""checkbox"" class=""checkbox"">` to get the styling. Alternatives:
   1. `input[type=""checkbox""]`: Then the class is not needed, but it would make it harder to use a custom checkbox. One day we might wanna add a ""toggle switch"" that also uses `<input type=""checkbox"">`.
   2. `.checkbox`: Some packages might already use that name in other ways (e.g. settings-view uses it as the wrapper for a checkbox). So a little more risky.
2. **Color**? Currently uses `@background-color-success`. Which is green in most themes. Alternative:
   1. Use `@background-color-info` which is blue in most themes. Would follow OS X default convention, but feel a bit uncanny if you have it set to OS X's grey theme.

@nathansobo @maxbrunsfeld @kuychaco: although similar, these new APIs serve a different purpose than the `TextBuffer.prototype.setTextsInBufferRanges` API (and the possible associated events) we have talked about, as they're meant to catch only user-triggered changes to the editor and they're much higher level, as they won't provide information about the changes (adding such information would indeed be tricky, as selections could do an arbitrary number of changes to the underlying buffer, and it would require a much more invasive refactoring).

``` js

var t = ""this should be at indentation 0"";

Fixed that.

Also revisited the logic regarding decreaseIndent and
decreaseNextIndent. It did not seem very logical that decreaseIndent
did _not_ correspond to increaseIndent: decreaseIndent regarded the
current line whereas increaseIndent regarded the next line (just like
decreaseNextIndent). For that reason I renamed decreaseIndent to
decreaseThisIndent and decreaseNextIndent to decreaseIndent. This way
we also avoid a whole lot of issues related to the concept of
decreaseNextIndent, because most of the language packages I looked at
have not yet adopted it but the semantics of decreaseIndent had
changed. So now the semantics of decreaseIndent is back to what it was
and decreaseThisIndent is the new concept.

Also now using the tokenized line to determine whether a in-/decrease
pattern appears within a quoted string (and ignoring it in that case),
rather than requiring regexes for checking whether or not the
occurrence is within a quoted string or not -- the examples I saw for
that were wrong, too (e.g., things like `/} [^""] /` are non-sense,
because things like `} var x = ""hey""` are perfectly fine). One really
needs to reason about balanced quotation to get it right, and the
tokenizer already does that for us, so let's use it rather than
reinventing the wheel. The decrease/increase regexes can now be much
simpler in the language packages.

9265,"This is an experimental branch which makes use of the [v8 snapshot feature](http://www.hashseed.net/2015/03/improving-v8s-performance-using.html) to preload some of the files Atom requires on startup.

:warning: Please, note that this is far from being finished and could potentially never be: I aim to constantly update this PR's description with what I find out, along with the performance savings that snapshotting brings us, but we could experience some limitation that will force us to ditch this technique. :warning:
### Why snapshotting?

If we look closely at the startup profile, we will soon notice that most of the time is spent in requiring files. This is somewhat a downside of using an interpreted language: everything from loading files into memory to executing them must happen at runtime.

With snapshotting, however, we're allowed to take a snapshot of the heap and make it available to the V8 context without actually running any code at runtime. Indeed, we can exploit this to load files during our build pipeline (i.e. `script/build`) and simply refer to the already required modules when Atom is executed.

We _think_ this could bring a decent speedup in our startup phase, which on my machine currently takes `1.0s`-`1.2s`.
### How does snapshotting works?

Electron provides a `mksnapshot` utility that allows to take a javascript file and turn it into a blob ready to be loaded in memory. After generating it, loading it is just a matter of copying it inside the Electron.framework directory:

``` bash
$ cp snapshot_blob.bin /Applications/Atom.app/Contents/Frameworks/Electron\ Framework.framework/Resources/snapshot_blob.bin
```

The capabilities that the _snapshot phase_ provides, though, are somewhat limited. Unfortunately, we won't have access to many of the handy facilities that we're allowed to use in a normal Electron application. For example:
1. Node;
2. Functions such as `Object::toString` (or anything else defined in v8 `js_natives`);
3. Native modules;

This means we have to change many (here I should say ""most"") of our files to be arranged in order to overcome the above limitations (e.g. by deferring `require`s of native modules).
### What's currently in this PR

I have managed to load the entire `text-buffer` library and to use it within Atom. I plan to go on with other expensive require paths, such as `src/project` and `src/config`.

I am still a bit unsure on how to proceed exactly, but before automating the generation of `snapshot.js`, I'd prefer to carefully include source files so that I can patch external libraries without actually opening PRs on the other repos. This is because I'd like to understand what are the realistic savings that this technique could allow us before delving into all the other details that concern building, etc.
### What's missing

Here I'll include what this PR would need in order to be :ship:ped. I do not expect to follow any of this point in a particular order, but they will serve as a good TODO list (also in case anyone wants to help out with this).
- [ ] Generate `snapshot.js` automatically. (right now I have manually included the source files)
- [ ] Change all the core source files so that they can be required in the snapshot.
- [ ] Change all the libraries source files so that they can be required in the snapshot.
- [ ] Include benchmarks to demonstrate the potential of snapshotting.
- [ ] Investigate how debugging changes when having functions already loaded in memory. (can we use source maps here somehow?)

8917,"On a high level, I would like to be able to use an alternative test runner for running tests in Atom. (Currently, [Atom uses Jasmine 1.3 for its test runner](https://atom.io/docs/latest/hacking-atom-writing-specs).) Atom already does a lot of great work to set up the test environment and to enable the test runner to run in-process, on par with other JavaScript in Atom. 

Previously, `spec-bootstrap.coffee` loaded `jasmine-helper.coffee`, which in turn loaded `vendor/jasmine`, `jasmine-tagged`, and `spec-helper.coffee` via `spec-suite.coffee` (which installs a bunch of properties on the globals `jasmine` and `window`, loading `jasmine-json` and `vendor/jasmine-jquery`, to boot!). The net effect of `spec-bootstrap.coffee` was to set up a bunch of helpers for Jasmine, register some Jasmine reporters, and run `jasmine.Env.execute()`.

With this change, the only requirement to be a ""test runner"" is to be a function that takes a hash of options and synchronously returns an object with an `execute()` method. This is much simpler. It also makes it possible to introduce a test runner that is completely independent from Jasmine.

The default implementation maintains the old behavior: `jasmine-helper.coffee` has become `jasmine-helper.js`. Where it used to export a `runSpecSuite()` function that could load an arbitrary file (which was always `spec-suite.coffee`, in practice) and then create a new `jasmine.Env` and `execute()` it, now `jasmine-helper.js` exports `runSpecSuite()` with its defaults baked in and it returns the `jasmine.Env` without executing it. Now it is up to `spec-bootstrap.coffee` to decide whether to load `jasmine-helper.coffee` or some other file and to invoke the `execute()` method on the resulting object that it creates.

Here is an example of an alternative/trivial implementation of a custom test runner that satisfies the contract:

``` js
'use babel';
/* @flow */

type TestRunnerOptions = {
  logFile: ?string,
};

type TestRunner = {
  execute(): void,
};

export default function createTestRunner({logFile}: TestRunnerOptions): TestRunner {
  return {
    execute() {
      atom.exit(0);
    },
  };
}
```

This PR introduces a new flag for the Atom executable, `--test-runner-bootstrap`, that makes it possible to specify the source of the alternative test runner. For example, if the above were defined at `/path/to/test-runner/bootstrap.js`, then it could be used as a test runner as follows:

```
atom --dev --test --test-runner-bootstrap /path/to/test-runner/bootstrap.js --spec-directory $PWD/spec
```

Part of the work of this PR was defining the types for the Jasmine object model to clarify the contracts in `jasmine-helper.js`. As Atom's test runner is an amalgam of Jasmine packages (`jasmine`, `jasmine-json`, `jasmine-node`, `jasmine-tagged`, and `jasmine-focused`), this was no easy task. These definitions appear at the top of `jasmine-helper.js` (formerly `jasmine-helper.coffee`). Writing this file in JavaScript makes it possible to do this using Flow types.

Originally, I tried to implement this PR by making a ""test runner"" an object that satisfied the contract of `jasmine.Env`. In practice, this turned out to be too difficult because so many libraries were adding expando properties onto `jasmine` that it made it too hard to get a full picture of the API that was required of Jasmine. For example, I was getting failures because `failure-tree.coffee` was looking for (as far as I could tell) undocumented properties on `jasmine.Spec` objects. Note that `failure-tree.coffee` comes from @kevinsawicki's fork of `jasmine-node` (https://github.com/kevinsawicki/jasmine-node.git), making it tough to trace through. As such, trying to create a `jasmine.Reporter` that met the needs of Atom's built-in `TerminalReporter` and `AtomReporter` objects seemed too difficult. Admittedly, this means that a custom test runner will not be able to take advantage of the default UI that is provided for Atom tests, but for now, I think this is OK.

Note that in `jasmine-helper.js`, I did not hoist inline `require()` calls as `import` statements because at least one of them has important side-effects, so it was unclear as to what was safe to move. I did my best to match Atom's JavaScript style, so I did not use semicolons, put spaces between `function` and `()`, etc.

Although `jasmine-helper.js` does not come close to Flow checking cleanly (Flow can't understand the
CoffeeScript files when tracing through a `require()` statement), I added an initial `.flowconfig`
file anyway so that basic features like click-to-symbol work in Nuclide. This also makes it possible
for Flow to report intelligent things about intra-file contracts.

https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/3650 and https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/6538 bring up a problem with how `Cursor.getCurrentWordBufferRange` works in some cases. For text like `atom-+electron`, here are results for different positions of the cursor and different values of the `includeNonWordCharacters` option:

| Cursor position | `includeNonWordCharacters = true` | `includeNonWordCharacters = false` |
| --- | --- | --- |
| <code>at&#124;om&#8209;+electron</code> | `atom` | `atom` |
| <code>atom&#8209;&#124;+electron</code> | `-+` | _nothing_ |
| <code>atom&#8209;+&#124;electron</code> | `-+electron` | `electron` |

The problem with the above is the inconsistency of behavior, lack of specs, and unclear documentation:
- When the cursor is between a word character and a non-word character (<code>atom&#8209;+&#124;electron</code>) and `includeNonWordCharacters = true`, then both the word characters and the non word characters are grouped into a single word (`-+electron`), but only those groups next to the cursor (notice that `atom` wasn't grouped into that).
- When the cursor is between two word characters (or two non-word characters) and `includeNonWordCharacters = true`, then only word characters or only non-word characters are grouped into a single word.
- The [documentation](https://github.com/atom/atom/blob/e1fb376a084f463c4f1e641cb89803dc3095f9b2/src/cursor.coffee#L616-L617) for the `includeNonWordCharacters` option is unclear -- it says: ""A Boolean indicating whether to include non-word characters in the regex."" But it's not clear if that means that the regex then groups both word and non-word characters into a single word, or that the regex groups non-word characters into words, but not together with word characters. The name of the option implies the former, but the behavior _mostly_ implies the latter.
- There are no specs around these methods which would indicate expected behavior, as far as I can tell.

My _guess_ is that the intended meaning of the `includeNonWordCharacters` option is ""should non-word characters be grouped together into a word (but never together with word characters)"". In other words, the `-+electron` result from table above should not happen since it contains both word and non-word characters, and would be considered a bug. Instead, the result should have been `electron` since that's the word next to the cursor (we favor words consisting of word characters, not words consisting of non-word characters).

Based on this guess -- I added specs in this PR to cover the cases shown in the table, and the only spec which fails is the one for `-+electron`:

```
TextEditor
  cursor
    .getCurrentWordBufferRange()
      when cursor is between a word character and non-word character
        when includeNonWordCharacters is true
          it returns the word next to the cursor, defined with word characters
            Expected { start : { row : 0, column : 4 }, end : { row : 0, column : 14 } } to equal [ [ 0, 6 ], [ 0, 14 ] ].
```

The reason why this problem happens lies in how the `Cursor.getCurrentWordBufferRange` methods works. That method scans to the left and to the right [to find the edge of words](https://github.com/atom/atom/blob/e1fb376a084f463c4f1e641cb89803dc3095f9b2/src/cursor.coffee#L551). However, it doesn't check if the cursor is between a word and a non-word character. That's relevant because if `includeNonWordCharacters` is `true` -- the method will group word and non-word characters together by joining the left and right part together. Some other methods in the `Cursor` class have the same problem (for example, [`getBeginningOfCurrentWordBufferPosition`](https://github.com/atom/atom/blob/e1fb376a084f463c4f1e641cb89803dc3095f9b2/src/cursor.coffee#L476) and [`getEndOfCurrentWordBufferPosition`](https://github.com/atom/atom/blob/e1fb376a084f463c4f1e641cb89803dc3095f9b2/src/cursor.coffee#L506) which `getCurrentWordBufferRange` uses for scanning) -- they don't check if the cursor is between a word and non-word character.

Interestingly, this check is made as a part of one other public method -- in [Selection.selectWord](https://github.com/atom/atom/blob/abf6d40cc4e3462a38fe2ce041d222d369e44147/src/selection.coffee#L315). Notice how this method uses `Cursor.isBetweenWordAndNonWord()` first, and modifies behavior based on that. I believe that logic should be in `Cursor` methods. In other words, `Cursor` methods should check if the cursor is between a word and non-word character and handle the situation when `includeNonWordCharacters` is `true`.

I'm not 100% sure about this, so definitely want to hear if this sounds good to everyone.

This PR fixes a few oversights from my last pass at this by properly overriding Bootstrap's default font styles for tooltips, and providing a new `'system'` fallback for `@font-family`. Omitting `@font-family` from bundled themes was breaking the build before, because these fallback variables weren't being loaded for bundled themes (and only bundled themes) for some reason. 

Now theme authors should be able to either omit `@font-family` or set `@font-family` to `'system'` to leverage OS default fonts.

This PR aims at addressing some issues (see e.g. #5901 ) about Atom integration in Windows shell context menu (i.e., the _right click_ menu in Explorer). In particular, with those changes:
1. user will be able to disable Atom commands in context menu by acting on Atom settings, without resorting to manually editing the registry. Of course s/he can also enable it back again
2. when Atom is updated, again user will not have to re-edit the registry (nor settings) because Atom will ""remember"" that items were disabled and keep them like that.
### Implementation
1. Windows Registry operations needed to be invoked by more than one place, so they have been extracted from `squirrel-update.coffee` and moved to a new `WinRegistry` module in `win-registry.coffee`.
2. Because registry operations need ChildProcess.spawn functionalities, those have been extract from  `squirrel-update.coffee` as well and moved to a new `Spawner` in `spawner.coffee`.
3. A new checkbox <-> boolean setting has been added to the core settings pane in `config-schema.coffee`.
4. The new setting is monitored by a dedicated module, `WinContextMenuSettings` in `win-context-menu-settings.coffee`. When setting changes, that is responsible for updating the registry by invoking `WinRegistry`
5. `atom.coffee` creates an instance of that monitor, and dispose that when it's time to
6. `WinContextMenuSettings` monitor got its own specs
7. Some `squirrel-update-spec.coffee` specs, related to ignoring errors, where actually a test on spawning functionality, so they have been moved to a new `spawner-spec.coffee`
8. Specs for the shell context menu integration upon update found place in `squirrel-update-spec.coffee`

8700,"This is part of our ongoing effort to cut down rendering times.

Apparently, our indent-guides have a modest impact on Layout. Currently, they are styled with `display: inline-block` so that they have the same height of line nodes. This produces the effect of a contiguous vertical line:

![screen shot 2015-09-07 at 14 21 42](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/482957/9716625/e2fdfa22-556b-11e5-93cf-7401d0a130fc.png)

My assumption is that, when rendering text runs, Chrome has to take a slightly different route to lay out inline blocks, thereby slowing down reflows.

As a result, if we use `display: inline` for indent guides as well, **Layout** decreases from `3.2ms – 3.5ms` to `2.0ms – 2.5ms` for a full reflow. This, however, has the consequence of showing indent guides as the following:

![screen shot 2015-09-07 at 14 25 59](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/482957/9716677/630db856-556c-11e5-9dc6-ab0363208af5.png)

I have worked with @simurai to find a performant replacement which didn't alter the UI, but we had no luck in our investigation. We might probably render indent guides _outside_ the line, but I am not sure it's really worth it, especially since users may be okay with the slowdown and still keep the contiguous line effect with a simple change in their stylesheet:

``` less
atom-text-editor::shadow .indent-guide {
  display: inline-block;
}

The reason why it exists is to let the browser continue firing `mousewheel` events even when the original line goes off-screen. Using this approach, instead of deleting it as we would do for other lines, we keep it around in the DOM until scrolling finishes.

This PR attempts to change that by forcing the browser to fire `mousewheel` events on the parent element. To achieve this, I made use of the following CSS:

``` css
.lines {
  * {
    pointer-events: none;
  }
}
```

This will prevent any kind of mouse interaction with `.lines` and `.line-numbers` descendants and therefore I am not sure about the implications of this solution. Fold icons in the gutter stopped working, but everything else seems to work nicely. I guess the question is: can we find a way to make `.lines` or `.line-numbers` the target of `mouse wheel` events?

This was a pretty quick fix to demonstrate the idea so I just opened a PR but we can easily discard it if it's unfeasible.

#### Background

Have a look at #6055 to get a sense of why we want to do this. @nathansobo did a great job at explaining the drawbacks of the current approach and how we could possibly solve them, so I strongly recommend to read that issue in depth.
#### Solution: `<iframe>`

The idea with the approach proposed in this PR is to have an independent context where we can arbitrarily build a bunch of DOM nodes exclusively for measuring purposes. We employed an `<iframe>` for this, so that a reflow in the measurement context does not affect the main document and viceversa.

To accomplish this we have introduced `LinesYardstick` (naming is hard :sweat_smile:), an abstraction whose purpose is to hide the complexity of dealing with the measurement context housekeeping. The API is simple:
- `buildDomNodesForScreenRows`
- `leftPixelPositionForScreenPosition`

We need to explicitly have two separate steps, as otherwise we’d end up continously changing the DOM and reading from it, thus causing extra reflows.
#### The Measurement Context

The context, as stated previously, is an `<iframe>` that replicates some of the functionalities featured on the fully fledged document, namely:
- Has a bunch of line nodes
- Includes a custom `<style>` element which contains font-size information
- Includes `<atom-styles>` which, in turn, contains the syntax theme

You can think of it as a skinny replica of the larger document, where line characters occupy the exact same space and are, therefore, measurable. It’s extremely important for this context to be independent, as we will use it in `TextEditorPresenter` as well as in `DisplayBuffer` (in the future).
#### Performance

**Side note**: this section is a collection of personal thoughts and may not be accurate or necessarily _correct_. However, it will hopefully serve as a starting point for further optimizations and discussions.

We have encountered several performance regressions along the way, especially for performance sensitive scenarios such as scrolling. Keep in mind that for such _intensive_ activities we need to respect the 16ms budget.

As of today, the steps we perform are the following:
1. Right before updating (i.e. at the beginning of `TextEditorPresenter#getState`), we build the DOM nodes for a bunch of screen rows we know we are going to measure:
   - All the rows that will be rendered on screen after the update (to make sure decorations, cursors, etc. will be able to measure stuff).
   - The longest row (to calculate the maximum width of the open document).
   - The last cursor row (to calculate the hidden input position).
2. As we update things (`@updateDecorations`, `@updateCursors`), we call `@pixelPositionForScreenPosition` which, in turn, will query `LinesYardstick` for positions. The first time this method is called, a `Recalculate Style` and a `Layout` will be triggered.

These are the two main operations and you can see how they perform on a quite heavy scrolling session (profiler disabled to avoid performance overhead):

![screen shot 2015-07-17 at 11 59 41](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/482957/8744934/5ed3ee00-2c7b-11e5-8e9a-accb2552ba9e.png)

And, if we zoom in one of those spikes:

![screen shot 2015-07-17 at 12 01 21](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/482957/8744964/90306546-2c7b-11e5-8a9c-d65e38a71eff.png)

The first half of the picture is the illustration of the aforementioned steps:
1. Building HTML: `1.33ms`
2. Parsing HTML: `1.28ms`
3. Recalculate Style: `0.839ms`
4. Layout: `1.408ms`

The whole frame took `20ms`; measuring the first half via Chrome (Shift+Click) reported `6ms`.

Now the question is: what could we improve? There are a couple of possibilities:
1. Build the same HTML for the lines in the context as well as for the lines in the real document. This way we can avoid reparsing the lines twice, although cloning the nodes still takes some time. Not sure if this is really useful.
2. Build skinnier lines for the measurement context. Ideally, we should avoid as much nesting as possible and, reducing the scopes complexity by building only those ones needed for styling, could improve that. It's also true that it would complicate things a bit (involves dealing with CSS rules, etc.). (eb8a1c0)
3. Be smarter about updates. Instead of including every possible line, we build and layout only those lines needed for position-based updates. The drawback here is that, when e.g. we have decoration for each visible row, this optimization is useless. This means I want to make sure to speedup the current process instead of relying on not having certain rows. Anyway, this improvement has a positive impact on `Layout`, `Recalculate Style` and HTML manipulation. To get a sense of what this could look like, here's a relevant snippet:
   
   ``` coffee
   getMeasurableScreenRows: ->
     measurableRows = new Set
   
     @addOverlaysRowsToSet(measurableRows)
     @addCursorsRowsToSet(measurableRows)
     @addDecorationsRowsToSet(measurableRows)
   
     if lastCursorRange = @model.getLastCursor()?.getScreenRange()
       measurableRows.add(lastCursorRange.start.row)
       measurableRows.add(lastCursorRange.end.row)
   
     if longestScreenRow = @model.getLongestScreenRow()
       measurableRows.add(longestScreenRow)
   
     measurableRows
   ```
4. Cut non-syntax CSS from styles. Removing `<atom-styles>` does not yield huge speedups, so I am not sure it's the first thing we want to improve. Still an improvement I’d like to make, though. (2257688)
5. Reduce layout times by trying to modify the measurement context without affecting the whole document. If we manage to always change the DOM in a way that affects only smaller layout boundaries, we may be able to halve reflow times. (28405e09afe097a8f40f90cb2166a47619c8feef)

I believe a combination of 2), 3), 4) and 5) could be interesting. HTML creation (and parsing) and `Layout` are the expensive operations right now and I am thinking to ways in which we could speed them up. I am still kinda making some research but I feel we could reach decent performance if we put some more effort on this. I'll investigate other potential speedups in the meantime. @nathansobo: what do you think?
#### Conclusion

If you have read everything so far, I extremely appreciate your attention. I feel like there are many ways to solve this problem, none of which is guaranteed to be the right one, thus I wanted to include as much of my knowledge as possible so that you and the future me can try things out based on it. :pray:

This implements something @simurai and I have been throwing around for awhile now – it removes all Atom core usage of `cursor: pointer` in favor of `cursor: default`. As @jerone put it in https://github.com/atom/settings-view/issues/531:

> Showing the cursor as a ""hand"" when hovering over things in the UI is a very ""web"" oriented convention.

This will go a long way, I think, toward making Atom feel less like a """"""website"""""" running in a semi-headless Chrome, and far more like a native app with a custom UI. :smile: 

_Note: This won't affect the styling of any components that explicitly declare another `cursor` type._

> But how will I know I can click on a thing? How will I know if a thing can be interacted with?

Here's how various OSes and desktop shells handle this:
- **OS X**: Occasionally a hover state, often a thing that looks like a button, but usually no way of knowing other than by clicking on it.
- **Windows**: Hover states.
- **GNOME 3**: Hover states.
- **Ubuntu Unity**: Hover states.

I think the safest bet here is to give actionable elements appropriate hover states as a replacement for `cursor: pointer`.

Although this is quite a sweeping change, it doesn't _entirely_ do away with `cursor: pointer` – the pointer should still be used when an element actually is an external link (whether it's an `a` element or not). Ideally this will be combined with https://github.com/atom/status-bar/issues/89 eventually.

TODO:
- [x] What do we do about actionable text? Right now it'll have a standard link-like underline hover state, but without `cursor: pointer`.

7593,"At CodeConf, we had a quick chat with a Chromium team member about how we could improve the rendering layer in Atom.

It turned out that Chromium is heavily optimized for non-absolutely positioned elements and, as a result, we may want to avoid using them for our lines nodes.

The main change we had to make in this PR was to ensure that lines were correctly sorted when inserting them in the DOM, so that the browser could properly figure out how to lay things out. I ended up employing a naive insertion sort algorithm which, although not super efficient, does its job and is pretty fast anyway given the small amount of lines.

Using the timeline, however, I couldn’t notice any major speedup:

It is subtle, but I can kinda feel it is a bit faster, hence it is likely that the Chrome timeline is not the right tool for the job and `about:traces` could tell a different story. 

@nathansobo: what’s your take on this? Should we go for this route? My opinion is that we may just continue using the absolute coordinates mechanism, as the benefits of this approach do not seem to be extremely evident.

Constructing the initial set of `TokenizedLine`s hangs the UI thread for large files. This PR performs this work in a background task for files above a certain size to avoid the pause, indicating progress with a progress bar. To integrate smoothly with existing packages, we open a `TextEditorLoader` item to display progress until the editor is fully loaded, then replace it with the editor afterward. This ensures that no packages attempt to interact with an editor in a partially loaded state.
## Remaining Issues
### Can't change grammars

We currently use tokenized lines to store horizontal spatial information such as hard tabs, paired unicode characters, soft-wrap indents, etc. This is in addition to their primary purpose of representing syntactic scopes. This entanglement makes it awkward to change the grammar once the file is loaded, because doing so replaces all the tokenized lines with the same placeholder lines we're constructing in the background to clear all the styling, then starts tokenizing again from the beginning. However, this takes a lot of time for a large file. Once the editor is loaded, I don't want to put it back in ""background loading"" mode because that implies a lot of complexity. Ideally I'd like to store the horizontal spatial information outside of the tokenized lines, so styling could be cleared without throwing away all this computation.
### Can't change tab length, invisibles, etc

Again, these require recomputing the tokenized lines from scratch. Invisibles can be dealt with by separating them out into a second rendering phase once our position calculation is more decoupled from the content of the model. Tab lengths are not so easy. We may be able to use our existing metadata about tab locations to update the lengths more efficiently in a synchronous way (without having to scan every token). Or we may want to just disable the ability to change it over a certain size. Or we may need to bite the bullet and figure out how to put the editor back in ""background loading"" mode after all. I'd like to put that off though.
### Long pauses before / after progress bar

The initial pause is due to loading the entire buffer in the background task before beginning processing. I just did this as a first pass implementation and will fix it before merging this. The second pause is autocomplete-plus populating its symbol table. We may want to disable it for now for files above a certain size, then work on optimizing this.
## Tasks
- [x] Display progress bar for loading in background
- [ ] Disallow operations that require recomputation of tokenized lines
- [ ] Optimize background task by computing results in a streaming fashion
- [ ] Do something about autocomplete plus

I may want to push tokenization to a background task in a different PR. That would allow us to at least select an initial grammar for large files instead of the null grammar as is currently the case on this PR. But I think loading huge files without highlighting is enough of an improvement to do that in a second pass.

This would be an absolutely positioned layer above all other window content (except modal panel layer). Panels are absolute positioned within it. Benefits include:
1. A standard place (using existing panel API) for inserting overlay elements. Now it seems the common practice is for packages to insert popover UI arbitrarily into the DOM.
2. Support more use cases then TextEditor 'overlay' decorations, because the popover panel layer would allow popovers anywhere in the Atom window, not just within a text editor. This layer might also be a place to solve https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/5469.
3. Optionally implement popover layout logic once instead of having each package implement it badly once. Popover layout logic is somewhat complex since generally popovers want to be positioned relative to an existing element while also not being clipped by screen edges.

This pull request is a minimal start. It defines the popover layer and API for adding panels. But it doesn't perform any positioning logic. Assuming people like this idea I would also like to add positioning options and logic with the basic goal being:
1. Uses should be able to position panel at arbitrary position on screen

6099,"#### Motivation

Currently, any npm modules we work on (e.g. `text-document`) need to use jasmine 1.3 so we can run specs in Atom, which is really useful for debugging. Without Atom's monkey-patched `waitsFor`, Jasmine 1.3 is basically unusable for testing async code (it only supports polling, no callbacks). Rather than have `text-document` and other libraries vendor atom/atom's customized version of jasmine 1.3, we should just use jasmine 2.
#### Changes

This allows packages and npm-modules to opt-in to using Jasmine-2.0 for the `application:run-package-specs` command in Atom. Packages opt in by adding `atom-jasmine: ""^2.0.0""` to the `engines` object in their `package.json`.

Currently, when using Jasmine 2, `spec-helper` is not loaded. I think it would be nice to eventually stop using the miscellaneous global functions defined in that file. Some of them (e.g. the non-standard `jasmine.advanceClock`) duplicate functionality that is built into jasmine.

I am thinking that some community members might be interested in upgrading individual package's test suites to use Jasmine-2.0. We could make `good-first` issues for doing that in various packages.
- [x] Make the `AtomReporter` support the jasmine 2 reporter API
- [x] Make sure `fit`, `fdescribe` et al work w/ jasmine 2
- [x] Make sure `apm test` works w/ jasmine 2
#### Questions
- [ ] This PR also removes the `application:run-all-specs` command. It doesn't seem like that command is used anymore, and it would have been difficult to preserve it while adding support for Jasmine-2.0 in the 
  AtomReporter. Also, it would be very difficult to support that command's functionality if individual packages started to migrate to Jasmine-2.0.
- [ ] Is the `engines.atom-jasmine` the right way to do this?

### Considerations

Most of the time was spent in autoscrolling (which is something we can do at the end of `joinLines`) and in updating the UI (some operations were not batched). Now time is spent mostly on scanning tokens, which is something that needs to be addressed in another layer (see #979).

![screen shot 2015-03-11 at 11 46 33](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/482957/6594782/866d817a-c7e4-11e4-9d4c-0a5464c8551f.png)

The situation is dramatically different for soft-wrapped lines. For this particular scenario, in facts, there's a significant amount of throwaway computation involved. When multiple lines are joined together, the operation does not happen atomically but causes `DisplayBuffer` to continuously update the first screen line as more and more lines are joined into the first one. This is quite cheap when soft wrapping is off, but it becomes very expensive when we turn it on:

![screen shot 2015-03-11 at 12 02 40](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/482957/6595024/8ffc8432-c7e6-11e4-976c-0cf6665e5e90.png)

:fearful:
- One solution could be to make `updateScreenLines` smarter, and reuse previous screen lines as a starting point for updates. However, that would involve a radical change in how we tokenize lines and I feel like this is an improvement that we should make at a lower layer, e.g. while addressing #979 
- Another way to tackle this would be to start batching `DisplayBuffer#handleTokenizedBufferChange` on `TextEditor#transact`. On one hand I find this quite smart, but on the other hand there's a lot of event-handling involved (e.g. markers) and I am afraid this change could break many things. Based on my first trials, I would say it will. @nathansobo: batching, batching everywhere :scream: :smile: 
- Alternatively, all those methods like `Selection#joinLines` could directly operate on the buffer, as if an external program performs the action, and `DisplayBuffer` sees only the final result. This is similar to the solution provided above, but addresses the issue from a different perspective, probably breaking abstraction.

Personally, I feel like the second solution provides quite a lot of benefits without breaking abstractions or changing how we deal with tokenized line. What do you think?

5813,"Previously, the challenge in restoring a root folder created by a `DirectoryProvider`
was that the `DirectoryProvider` that created the root folder during the previous
session may not be available when the `Project` is restored via deserialization.

This adds a new method to the `DirectoryProvider` API named `getHostPackage()`
(it also bumps the version of `atom.directory-provider` from 0.1.0 to 0.2.0).
A `DirectoryProvider` must return the name of the Atom package that provided it
or `null`. (Surprisingly, it is not possible to get this information programmatically
today, though ServiceHub could potentially be expanded to provide this. However,
it would only work for providers statically declared in `package.json`, but not for
those that are registered dynamically, so it might not be worth it.)

When a `Directory` is created via a `DirectoryProvider`, the correspoding Atom
package via `DirectoryProvider::getHostPackage()` is recorded as part of the `Project`
so it can be serialized along with the `Project`'s paths.

This way, when `Project` is deserialized, paths that have a corresponding ""host package""
can be filtered from ones that do not. Paths without a corresponding host package will
be loaded normally. Those with a host package will have their package activated so
the `DirectoryProvider` can be restored, which will hopefully be able to recreate the
root folder from the previous session.

When a new `DirectoryProvider` is registered, the `Project` checks to see whether
there were any paths from the previous session that correspond to its host package.
If so, each path is fed to the provider's async `directoryForURI` method. Assuming it
returns a `Promise` that returns a non-null value, the path will be added to the
`Project` via `atom.project.addPath()`. This allows the provider to do any async I/O
or network communication it needs to do to recreate the `Directory` (which it should
cache) before its synchronous `directoryForURISync()` method is invoked as a side-effect
of `atom.project.addPath()`. Assuming the provider caches the path->`Directory` mapping
during the async invocation, it can return it immediately as part of the sync invocation.

The problem, is copying pasting PHPDoc code at an indented level, with hard tabs on, loses the asterisk alignment:

![example](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/939815/6273202/41e81dbe-b865-11e4-8ea5-a5354bdbb50c.gif)

**Root Cause**

Seems inside Atom, in the case of encountering soft tabs in a hard tab file... it can return a _floating point_ indentation level, such as 1.5 in this instance (tab+half-tab). When rebuilding the indentation (it calls setIndentationForBufferRow for each line), this calls @buildIndentString with 1.5 which gets converted to integer: 1. ALL leading whitespace is then replaced by this new indentation - so we lose the space that aligns the asterisk.

The tests seem to point to floating point indentation levels being allowed. Yet I can find nowhere where it is useful. Most places just Math.ceil(). And with hard tabs it doesn't even make sense.

This patch attempts to remove all the floating points (it leaves the Math.ceil calls - they're harmless and can be cleaned later if this turns out the right approach.). It then has a function for ""modifying"" whitespace to change its indentation level, while paying attention to straggling spacing like that in the PHPDoc comments in the image above. It also adds a couple API for handling indentation changes that can be used elsewhere.

Only thing I'm not too happy with is the overlap between my ""setIndentLevelForRow"" and the existing ""setIndentationForBufferRow"" - I'm sure mine follows correct naming convention but existing doesn't. It is the existing one that is called when pasting though.

### What doesn't work
- [ ] `TerminalReporter`. I excluded it for the time being and I am using Jasmine's `ConsoleReporter` 'cause it seems to provide almost all functionalities. On the other hand it seems like `apm test` doesn't exit (even when specs have finished) and I suppose it may be related to this; 
- [ ] `TimeReporter`. 2.0 introduced a new way of creating custom reporters and this has to be adapted as well.
- [ ] Old async specs. I provided some examples (e.g. upgrading some specs) about how Jasmine 2 is supposed to work with asynchronous tests. You can find more information [here](https://github.com/jasmine/jasmine/issues/526).
- [ ] Old custom matchers. The syntax has changed for those as well. I updated `vendor/jasmine-jquery.js` to allow some of the matchers to be compatible with the new specification, but there are still a bunch of them which aren't ported yet;
- [ ] Old spies expectation. Many expectation have changed since 1.3 and now need to be upgraded (`andCallThrough` vs. `and.callThrough`)
- [ ] `setIncludedTags`. This should filter out some specs as far as I understand, but Jasmine doesn't seem to provide an alternative. Needs further investigation. 
- [ ] `waits(0)`. This served as a way of yielding to the UI thread. `waits` method does not exist anymore, and therefore we need to find another solution.
- [ ] `setSpecField`. `currentRunner()` method has been deprecated, thus we need to find another solution. I wonder if this is still needed, therefore it would be great if you could provide some feedback :pray:
- [ ] Suspicious Jasmine initialization. I am not 100% sure the solution below is the best practice to load Jasmine, but I couldn't find any other feasible initialization strategy. Needs investigation but it should be straightforward.
  
  ``` coffee
  Jasmine = require ""jasmine""
  window.jasmine = (new Jasmine).jasmine
  
  {ConsoleReporter} = require ""jasmine""
  ```
- [ ] Running test via UI. For now I have only used `apm test` to run tests, but we need to make sure that `AtomReporter` works fine as well.

### Discussion

As @thedaniel mentioned on #5354 one of the main concerns of upgrading is to keep package specs working. Quoting his statement:

> All community package specs are written to 1.3 so there would need to be some kind of mechanism to allow a package to opt-in to 2.0 and run 1.3 by default

A possible solution may be to have two separate suites:
- A jasmine 2 bootstrap, which loads all the specs that are known to be compatible (package owners may tag such specs somehow, maybe a filename suffix or a subdirectory could be sufficient);
- A jasmine 1.3 bootstrap (the default one), which will load any other spec;

I am still not sure how difficult could it be to make this approach work, but I hope we can discuss about it :smile:

/cc @maxbrunsfeld: I got the get/set API looking good.
### Problems with Config API

The Config API still has some awkwardness leftover from when scoped settings were merged in. It would be nice to make the API more coherent considering the expanded role of settings.
- We're using a private method, `::addScopedSettings` in packages. We need a public equivalent. The main difference is that `::addScopedSettings` takes a `source` argument. The `source` is used to distinguish between user settings and package settings internally, so it's important.
- Methods related to defaults don't make sense in the presence of scoped settings. The methods `::isDefault`, `::restoreDefault`, and `::getDefault` don't actually deal with true _default_ values from the schemas. Instead they consider a value ""default"" if its source isn't the user's `config.cson`
### Proposed Solution

We can eliminate `::addScopedSettings` and the methods that deal with defaults from the API. Instead, we replace them with the ability to talk about the _source_ of a given setting when getting and setting it. Then the settings view can make decisions based on the source being the user's `config.cson`, rather than exposing a murky conception of ""default"" in settings.

We propose to replace the following methods:
- getDefault
- isDefault
- restoreDefault
- addScopedSettings

With these new signatures for get and set
- set(keyPath, value, [{scopeSelector, source}])
- get(keyPath, [{scope, sources, excludeSources}])

Plus the new `unset` method... which can be used to remove a single key path or all key paths from a given scope.
- unset([keyPath], [{source}])

If we need to know if a value is assigned in the user's settings, we specify the desired _source_ in our getter. If we get no value back, we can assume we're using some other value (maybe a schema default, mabye from a package). If we want to determine the non-user-assigned value, we exclude it as a source when getting the setting.
### Steps
- [x] Store global settings in the scoped property store under `*` so they're associated with a source
- [ ] Refactor the scoped-property-store to allow mutating values without always adding new entries to the cascade (atom/scoped-property-store#8).
- [ ] Bugfix: Ensure the most recently assigned setting is honored when there is a specificity tie.

4558,":warning: WIP :warning:

- [ ] Associate all settings with a source regardless of whether or not they are scoped

- [ ] Add `excludeSources` option to `Config::get`
- [ ] Use actual user settings path as the user settings source
- [ ] Add `Config::unset` to remove a setting from the user-config source
- [ ] Add `Config::unsetFromSource` to remove all settings or one setting from a given source
- [ ] Deprecate `is/get/restoreDefault` methods and replace with `get` and `set` plus `source` options

Previously, the private method `::addScopedSettings` was used to associate config settings with a source other than the user's config file. It bypassed schema validation.

## Concerns About Current View Registry

Originally, the view registry had three main responsibilities:
- A centralized place to register view providers, which describe how element constructors associate with model constructors.
- A factory that can create a view for a given model based on the above providers.
- A 1:1 mapping from models to views that persists for the lifetime of each model.

After working with the system and talking with @maxbrunsfeld, I'm very concerned about the pitfalls associated with maintaining a _global_ 1:1 mapping between models and views. Currently, the only way to create a new view with providers is via `atom.views.getView`, which returns an existing view if one already exists. If a user called this method thinking they were creating a new view, but one already existed, they could potentially move the existing DOM node from its previous location on the DOM. Beyond that: are we confident enough that we'll want a 1:1 correspondence between models and views _everywhere_ that we want to force those semantics globally if anyone wants to use our factory?
## Proposed Changes

In response to these concerns, this PR separates the view _factory_ functionality from the view _registry_ functionality, meaning you can use the factory to create a view without buying into the 1:1 map. The factory remains global at `atom.views` and has two methods, `::createView` and `::addViewProvider`. The _registry_ is moved inside of WorkspaceElement and is proxied via `WorkspaceElement::getView`.

If a user wants to get a reference to a particular model's existing view _in the workspace_, then they should call `::getView` on the workspace element. If they want to create a _new view_, then they can use `.createView` on the global factory. This radically reduces the amount of global state we're tracking, making `atom.views` a more reasonable global service. It also discourages people from referencing the view from the model layer since `::getView` can only be accessed if you already have a reference to the view layer.
## Open Questions
### Accessing the Workspace Element?

Prior to this PR, it was possible to get a reference to the workspace element with `atom.views.getView(atom.workspace)`. It wasn't a particularly attractive incantation, but at least it was possible. There's now no longer any way to get access to the workspace element short of direct DOM querying:

``` coffee
workpaceElement = document.querySelector('atom-workspace')
```

It actually reads clearer than accessing it via `atom.views`, but it still feels awkward for some reason to have to pull this off the DOM with a query. One idea is that we could add a `document.workspace` property as a shorthand for querying the selector. We could even automatically create the workspace element when that property is referenced for the first time in specs.

It seems very much inline with existing shorthand properties such as `document.body` and `document.head`, and since the user would be going through `document` it would emphasize that you are entering DOM territory when you call this. The downside is that we would be adding a non-standard property to the `document` object.

Another option is `atom.workspaceElement`. Or we just force people to query for it.
### Clarify The Global Name?

I kinda want to change `atom.views` to `atom.viewFactory`. That will add yet more deprecation warnings for APIs that we've made public as part of the 1.0 freeze effort, but I think long-term clarity could be worth the short-term incremental pain.

These views are now based on a new version of SpacePen that uses custom elements to provide attach/detach hooks instead of relying on patches to jQuery DOM manipulation in atom/atom, which will be going away. They should be able to be used pretty much exactly as the old views were, except that simulated DOM attachment won't trigger attach hooks.

For the time being we need to continue to export a version of these views that behaves exactly the same, including a [bunch of Atom-specific extensions](https://github.com/atom/atom/blob/master/src/space-pen-extensions.coffee) to SpacePen and jQuery that don't really belong in the extracted libraries.

3378,"## Abstract

We have many situations where we need to subscribe to streams of events, such as discrete events like `did-insert-text`, properties with values that change over time, and collections with contents that change over time. The concept of _observables_ unifies all these callback-oriented patterns in a single compositional framework. The [RxJS](https://github.com/Reactive-Extensions/RxJS) library provides a mature and full-featured implementation of the observables concept, and I'd like to try using it in workspace. If it works well, we can consider using it for our events across the board.
## Tasks
- [ ] Benchmark to make sure overhead is acceptable in simple use cases
- [ ] :wrench: Replace workspace events with `::onX` methods that return observables
- [ ] :wrench: Replace workspace behaviors with `::observeX` that return observables
- [ ] Replace workspace `::eachX` methods with `::observeX` methods
## Description
### Events

We currently implement events via emissary's `Emitter` mixin. In the following example, we use `::on` to subscribe to all changes and `::once` to subscribe to the next change. Both methods return subscriptions which can be disposed with

``` coffee
subscription = editor.on 'text-did-change', -> # ...
subscription = editor.once 'text-did-change', -> # ...
```

Subscribing to events with strings is fragile and difficult to document, shim, and deprecate. We've discussed changing the API to use methods instead, such as `::onTextDidChange`, but there were concerns about losing `::once`. Returning an Rx observable gives us the ability to use `::once` semantics and also ton more.

Our `::on*` methods can be overloaded, so they subscribe if passed a callback and return an observable if no callback is passed.

``` coffee
# If a callback is passed, subscribe as normal
subscription = editor.onTextDidChange -> # ...

# If no callback is passed, return an observable
observable = editor.onTextDidChange()

# You can subscribe to observables
subscription = observable.subscribe -> # ...

# But you can also apply operators, such as `::take`.
# This is equivalent to `::once` from the example above.
subscription = observable.take(1).subscribe -> # ...

# You can also apply other operators, such as `::throttle`
# Here we will not handle text changes more often than once per 500ms
subscription = editor.onTextDidChange().throttle(500).subscribe -> # ...
```
### Properties That Change

In addition to events, we also need to track values that change over time. Observables are a great tool for this as well, and could replace `emissary` behaviors. For any model property `foo`, we could have an `observeFoo` method along with `getFoo` and `setFoo`. This would return an observable based on the current value of the property. Whenever someone subscribed, the `onNext` callback would be called immediately with the current value, then again whenever the value changed.

``` coffee
# Just like with `::on*` methods, `::observe*` can be passed a callback.
subscription = pane.observeActiveItem -> # ...

# Observe methods return an observable when called without a callback.
observable = pane.observeActiveItem()
subscription = observable.subscribe -> # ...

# If you only want changes and not the current value, skip it
# This is similar to passing `callNow: false` to config.observe,
# and could replace it
subscription = pane.observeActiveItem().skip(1).subscribe(@onActiveItemChanged)
```

Compositional operators can also be used to derive more advanced behaviors, such as `PaneContainer::observeActivePaneItem`, which will be based on the active item of the active pane.

``` coffee
class Workspace
  observeActivePaneItem: ->
    @observeActivePane().selectSwitch (activePane) ->
      activePane.observeActiveItem()
```
### Collections That Change

In addition to properties that change, we also deal with collections that change, such as the current panes, pane items, text editors, etc. These can also be modeled as observables. In the following example, `::observePanes` returns an observable that yields every current and future pane to observers.

``` coffee
# Can be called with a callback to subscribe immediately
subscription = atom.workspace.observePanes -> # ...

# When called without a callback, returns an observable
subscription = atom.workspace.observePanes().subscribe -> # ...
```

Again, the compositional nature of observables allows us to easily build derived collections, such as a collection based on all pane items.

``` coffee
class Workspace
  observePaneItems: ->
    @observePanes().flatMap (pane) -> pane.observeItems()
```

Such a method could filter on optional type selectors, allowing you to observe only a certain subset of panes.

``` coffee
class Workspace
  observeTextEditors: ->
    @observePaneItems('.text, .source')

  # The filter step would probably go in Pane::observeItems, but this
  # illustrates the concept.
  observePaneItems: (selector) ->
    @observePanes().flatMap (pane) ->
      pane.observeItems().filter (item) ->
        item.getTypeDescriptor?().matches(selector)
```
### Conclusion

RxJS provides a rich, seemingly mature library for working with streaming data in a compositional manner. We can utilize it in the following scenarios:
- For events, by adding `::onFoo` methods that return an observable when they aren't passed a callback.
- For changing properties and collections, by adding `::observeFoo` methods that return observables that invoke subscribers with current and future values.

It seems worth exploring as a robust solution to event handling in Atom that can slot in next to simpler approaches.

## Underlayer Deprecation

Opaque tiles improve performance, but they destroy the previous ability to attach absolutely-positioned elements to the underlayer and have things just work. Based on [this search](https://github.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=editorView+underlayer&type=Code&ref=searchresults), the following packages access the `.underlayer` outlet on the editor. Checkboxes are for adding the necessary APIs and creating issues/PRs on the package repositories:

Could use highlight decorations instead:
- [x] https://github.com/richrace/highlight-selected (https://github.com/richrace/highlight-selected/issues/17)

- [ ] https://github.com/yujinakayama/atom-lint
- [ ] https://github.com/atom/bracket-matcher
- [ ] https://github.com/atom/spell-check

Could use highlight decorations if we allowed arbitrary style assignment:
- [ ] https://github.com/wonnage/highlight-css-color

Could potentially use highlight decorations if we added a `fullHeight` and `fullWidth` option:
- [ ] https://github.com/tony612/highlight-column
- [ ] https://github.com/jtanner/crosshairs
- [x] https://github.com/richrace/highlight-line (https://github.com/richrace/highlight-line/issues/23)

## Background

I'll explain more as this develops, but I'm experimenting with a new rendering strategy for the editor that's yielding promising results on Chromium 36. I've tried this before and closed it, but things are going better on this newer rendering engine and a bit more maturity in the `EditorComponent` code. The current rendering strategy exhibits some pretty serious performance regression on Chromium 36, so some kind of optimization work is something of a blocker for shipping it.

Here's a look at the composited layer borders in orange.

Here's a promising timeline of scrolling around at moderate speed, showing we're meeting most of our frame times with room to spare at 60 FPS.

![screenshot 2014-08-01 10 12 18](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1789/3785973/9825c032-19cd-11e4-93eb-569adbab0239.png)

I'm also pretty close clearing 13ms frame times for cursor movement (which is what I have my key repeat rate set at so it's important to me) with a different strategy for requesting frames. I wish I could supply `requestAnimationFrame` with my desired frame time for a given request. For now I'm hoping a synchronous rendering strategy for certain operations will suffice.

You never really know until it's fully implemented, but this is promising. The gutter is disabled because it's not yet tiled, and the cursors and highlight decorations (responsible for selections, among other things) haven't been fully implemented yet. But I'm feeling pretty good.

My implementation follows the traditional X11 behaviour as closely as possible:

2. When pasting, the text cursor goes to a position under the mouse, then the second clipboard data are pasted (ie. it ignores and overwrites the previous cursor position and selection).
3. When copying, text is copied to the second clipboard only if I select the text with a mouse (not with a keyboard, not if the text is selected with some kind of automatic behaviour). This also includes double-click and triple-click selection.
4. When I deselect the text (this is why I check the length), the second keyboard is left intact.

In #2704, I attempted to make the lines the full width of the editor at all times. As soon as I did this, I started getting really bad jitter when scrolling, especially when using the discrete Nvidia graphics card on my Retina MBP.

So last night I thought I'd try a new approach. I'd tried it briefly before but now I'm coming to the situation with more knowledge and I no longer have a concern about opaque backgrounds for subpixel anti-aliasing, which didn't work anyway. I asked myself: what's the lightest possible load we can put on the graphics processor while still having it scroll our lines for us.

The issue with the approach on master is that we represent the lines as one giant layer, then paint into this layer as it is scrolling. I have no idea how it works internally so I'm working from conjecture, but it seems like having a really big layer would put more pressure on the GPU. So what if instead we break the lines and line numbers into many small layers or tiles, like the iPhone does when scrolling web pages. Then each of these layers can be controlled independently on the GPU, and we just keep creating more as they are needed when we scroll.

It's actually working better than anything I've tried so far. The tile sizes for the gutter and the lines can be tuned independently to strike a balance between having a small number of layers and not having the layers get too big. I played with the sizes a bit to find the current settings, but we could potentially tune more carefully.

![tiling](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1789/3350087/b1a4bf36-f98e-11e3-8bc6-4c802d5d4695.gif)

This is going to require some rethinking of highlights and clever shimming for underlayer and overlayer views, but I think it's doable. And I think we need to do it, because the jitter caused by making the lines full width is really quite intolerable. As an added bonus, I think this approach lets us use React components for lines and line numbers with acceptable overhead because we can halt the updates at the level of their groupings to prevent excessive diffing. It's kinda cool that the same structure that's kind to the GPU is also kind to React. Maybe not a coincidence.

Previous to 0b5b741db4d5b03d6b97cc217ae2c40df892fa62 i was building atom on Win32 fine. The other day i fetched new commits from atom and my builds wouldn't work anymore :cry:

```
H:\src\atom [master]> .\script\build
You must have Python 2.7 installed at 'C:\Python27\'
```

i thought i broke something. i commented out that check and everything built fine because i do have python on my machine and its installed location on my path.
## EDIT: See this much more better restatement of the problem

See [this comment](https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/2351#issuecomment-44435957) for a better statement of the problem.
#### i propose

This PR adds a check for Python27 on the path on win32 machines and if it isn't, `script/build` says:

> You must have Python 2.7 in your path

My initial solution is just to tell win32 builders that Python should be on the path. It may not be the best way, but it seems like a step forward to me. That seems like a reasonable thing to ask someone trying to build this :smile:. i wish i knew about a `which python`-like solution for node.
#### history and previous discussions

i'm conscious of [this conversation](https://github.com/atom/atom/commit/0b5b741db4d5b03d6b97cc217ae2c40df892fa62#diff-be3d85f44f8c9d04e5ce9becabab892b) and [this one](https://github.com/atom/atom/commit/f30c56c237dd157e0a12e21e86c832ec393a03d6#diff-be3d85f44f8c9d04e5ce9becabab892b), both mentioning that Python isn't installed on the path by default, so i'm aware that this isn't a perfect solution or may not be what you're looking for (the idea has already been floated for what i've done).

If this isn't the way to go about it, maybe we can :hammer: that out here?
#### A brief aside

This isn't a big deal for me, and i could be wrong, so i'll quote Mr. Paul Betts's [comment](https://github.com/atom/atom/commit/0b5b741db4d5b03d6b97cc217ae2c40df892fa62#commitcomment-6336933) out of context:

- **Developer's Manual:** This will be a high-level overview of various subsystems and concepts in Atom that's a bit higher level than the API docs. It's still fundamentally a reference.
- **Tutorials:** Take the key concepts from the developer's manual, break them into concrete examples, and sequence them in an easy-to-follow way. I'm thinking these can be based around explaining how to build one or more of our core packages.

1481,"It appears that you cannot specify custom key bindings for items that appear in the application menu. I ran into the following issue while working on atom/tree-view#34; do the following to reproduce:
1. Clone [BinaryMuse/tree-view](https://github.com/BinaryMuse/tree-view) into `~/.atom/dev/packages/tree-view` and switch to the `bt-copy-paths` branch.
2. Fire up Atom with `atom -d` and, with a file open and focus in the editor, press `ctrl-C`. Notice that the path of the file has been copied into the clipboard by `editor:copy-path`.
3. Focus the tree view and select a different entry without changing the open file. With the tree view focused, press `ctrl-C`. Notice that the clipboard still contains the path to the currently open file, even though the `bkt-copy-paths` branch specifies that `ctrl-C` for `.tree-view` should execute `tree-view:copy-full-path`.

This happens because `ApplicationMenu` determines the specific command to execute when the menu item is clicked, without consulting the keymap specificity rules; this seems necessary for commands that are handled by `AtomApplication`.

This pull request introduces a change that sends the _keystroke_ to `WindowEventHandler`, instead of the command, in the case where `AtomApplication` does not handle the command itself.

Specs pass and things appear to work, but I'm not sure of the wider repercussions of this change, and would love to get some eyes on it. For one thing, since menu commands may now trigger different commands based on specificity, there may be a disconnect between what the menu item says and what it actually does. (This is okay for my example, where `ctrl-C` is bound to ""Copy Path"" in the menu, which makes sense in the new tree view context, but a user could easily rebind commands so that they no longer make sense--but maybe we don't care.)

1317,"`activation events` are used to speed up window load time, slow packages aren't immediately loaded until a keybinding is pressed. But larger packages that take > 0.5 seconds to load (like [find and replace](https://github.com/atom/find-and-replace/issues/99) become unresponsive for a brief period of time. This could be fixed by ensuring every packages loads quickly, but this isn't realistic because packages created by other people will be out of our control. Another approach would be to intercept all events during package loading and then re-trigger the events after the package is loaded, but this will still feel sluggish and tightly couple the event code to jQuery.

This prototype pr works like this. If a package has activation events it will load as before, but Atom will also sequentially load these packages each tick. This activates all packages without having a noticeable effect on window load time. The worst case scenario is for a brief time (800ms i this case) the behavior in issue atom/find-and-replace#99 will still occur.

Such as:
- `alt-n` followed by an `a` types an `ã`
- `alt-e` followed by an `e` types an `é`.

This is useful if you are typing these characters but also makes the `alt-e` and `alt-n` keybindings unusable in a keymap since they generate the same key event `alt-å` and you can't distinguish between two in code. Type `alt-n` in the editor with the keybindings-resolver open to see for yourself.

One possible fix for this is to set type `password` on the hidden input since these characters can't be typed into password fields in this manner and so the key events go back to ""normal"" and `alt-e` and `alt-n` can now be used again in keymaps.

This PR adds a preference `editor.enableI18nSupport` that toggles the hidden input between `text` and `password`.

Other ideas/approaches are welcome, this is just an initial stab at it after @benburkert reported not being able to use `alt-n` in his keymaps file.

I'm redesigning the panes system as a self-contained demonstration of a number of ideas I have for improving the experience of working with Telepath and working with models and views. First, I'll summarize the problems I'm hoping to address, then move on to discuss my solutions as manifested in the redesign of the panes system. Some of what's expressed here is aspirational, but most of it works now. I'd like to get _everything_ working by the time I get to San Francisco on Monday night, then discuss it further in person.
## Problems

Here are the problems I've been concerned about, in rough order of importance:
- **The relationship between model objects and their underlying Telepath documents is full of accidental complexity and boilerplate.**
  Every model class needs to implement `::serialize`, `::deserialize`, and `::getState`. Model implementors also need to manually read, write, and observe every replicated property in the underlying document. Existing models currently have extremely similar code repeating all of these tasks.
- **Reliance on global variables makes replication extremely difficult to test.**
  The nature of testing means both copies of a replicated component exist in the same global JavaScript context, but if the component relies on global variables in that context it becomes very difficult to simulate the production situation of the components actually being in different contexts. We currently employ a test-only Environment object to repeatedly swap globals in replicates specs, and it's pretty awkward.
- **Structural updates, where an object is removed from the document only to be reattached elsewhere, are difficult to express in a replicated setting.**
  One example of this is pane splitting. When we split a pane vertically for the first time, we need to replace the pane being split with a _horizontal pane axis_ containing the original pane along with a new pane. Panes can retain arbitrary resources. For example, a pane that contains an editor causes that editor's buffer to be kept resident in a list of active buffers, so that all editors for a given file can share the same buffer state. But when an editor is removed, we want to remove its buffer from the list of active buffers if no other editors are retaining it. But we _don't_ want to release the buffer when splitting, because we're only removing the pane temporarily and intend to add it back to the document before yielding the UI thread. We currently express this in terms of reference counts and transactions, but especially in the context of replication, the code has been awkward and difficult to reason about.
- **Because of JavaScript's single-threaded environment, we need to use asynchronous APIs in an ever-increasing amount of our code, which makes control flow more awkward and difficult to reason about.**
  In a pre-Node environment, we made a pragmatic decision to largely ignore the sync/async issue and make everything synchronous. The wisdom of that past choice can be debated, but it's clear now that anything that performs IO must provide an asynchronous API as the default if we want to be performant. This reduces the utility of synchronous flow control constructs like loops and conditionals, and pushes us more toward callback-oriented programming. It's not the end of the world, but it doesn't scale very well as complexity increases.
- **There's too much logic in our view code.** From the beginning, I favored an absolute minimalist approach and advocated that view framework code be kept to a minimum, which led to us baking a lot of logic into our views. The panes system is a poster-child for the downsides of that approach. Entangling the DOM's concerns into the core behavior of our components is easy for simple components, but scales terribly with complexity. It makes code significantly more difficult to reason about due to worrying about DOM concerns such as attachment in addition to application behavior, and worse, it makes tests way slower than they should be, which slows development.
## Goals for addressing these problems

The goal of this pull request is to address the above problems in the following ways:
- **Make it simple and easy to write replicated models objects.**
- **Encapsulate the state of the system, while retaining as much of the convenience of global variables as possible.**
- **Make it possible to manipulate structural relationships without removing objects from the document and reinserting them elsewhere.**
- **Provide reactive abstractions that enable us to write _structured_ asynchronous code.**
- **Provide a clean, boiler-plate-free mechanism for binding views to view models.**

In addition, this PR has the following meta-goals:
- **Approachable power.**
  Telepath must support programming styles that are familiar to most programmers. All abstractions must fit naturally into an imperative, document-oriented worldview, and present minimal conceptual overhead until people are ready to use them.
- **""Have it your way.""""**
  Users will still have to write data into the document for it to be replicated or persisted, but you won't be _forced_ to use the model-based convenience facilities. They can continue to relate to Telepath as a raw document store, leveraging hooks on an a la carte basis.
## Implementation
### A Model Superclass

Telepath now exports a `Model` class, which users can subclass to easily create a document-backed model object. They can use the `.property` and `.properties` class method to declare replicated properties and provide them default values, and the model class will automatically define dynamic properties on their class's prototype. Under the hood, everything will be automatically read from and written to a `state` document that is wrapped by the model instance.

``` coffee
{Model} = require 'telepath'

module.exports =
class Pane extends Model
  @properties
    activeItemId: null
    items: []

# I can assign replicated properties when constructing a model
pane = new Pane(items: [item1, item2], activeItemId: item2.id)

# I can read and write replicated properties without calling getters/setters:
expect(pane.items).toEqual [item1, item2]
pane.activeItemId = item1.id
```

This isn't implemented yet, but I'd like to easily declare replication and persistence on a property-specific basis:

``` coffee
class MyClass
  @property 'transientProperty', persist: false, replicate: false
  @property 'persistentProperty', persist: true, replicate: false
```
### Automatic (De)serialization

If you insert a `telepath.Model` subclass into a document (or any instance that conforms to a small interface), the object's underlying state document will automatically be inserted instead. Similarly, when any map with a `modelClassName` key is inserted into the document, the correct model class will automatically be instantiated for it if a model class with that name has been registered on the parent document. When you read the child document at a replica or after deserializing, you'll get its corresponding model class instance instead.

``` coffee
# Assuming 2 replicated documents doc1 and doc2
doc1.registerModelClass(Pane)
doc2.registerModelClass(Pane)

doc1.get('paneContainer.children').push(new Pane(items: [item1, item2]))

# replicates to doc 2...
pane = doc2.get('paneContainer.children.0')
expect(pane.constructor.name).toBe ""Pane""
expect(pane.items).toEqual [item1, item2]
```
### Scoped Property Resolution

We use global properties in Atom to provide convenient services, such as the `project` global, which can be used to open editors for various resources under the project and the `syntax` global, which can be used to select grammars. But as discussed above, the globals are causing problems when we want to test replication between two environments, because it makes it impossible to express component logic in a self-contained way.

Dependency-injection is a popular alternative to accessing services via globals, but dependency injection seems like an awkward cultural fit for JavaScript. It feels heavy and I'd be a bit sheepish about asking people to build all their objects via some container like they're writing a Spring application.

However, we're already asking users to interact with a global Telepath document if they want to hook into replication or persistence for their objects. We might as well throw in a form of dependency injection as part of the deal.

The mechanism resolves around the `::getResolved` and `::setResolved` methods, which are available on every Telepath document. When you call `::getResolved` with a property name, Telepath will search for a property with that name, starting at the receiver and moving upward toward the root of the document. `::setResolved` does the same thing, but allows you to assign a new value to the first object with the given key.

This makes it easy to have a world in which objects in two different document replicas each can make reference to their own specific ""global"" properties while still keeping both replicas self-contained.

The `telepath.Model` superclass provides a `Model.resolved` class method for declaring auto-resolved properties. Putting it all together, it enables this mechanism for `PaneContainer` to maintain a single active pane. Each pane will resolve the `activePaneId` property to the containing PaneContainer, allowing panes to make themselves active or check if they are active.

``` coffee
class PaneContainer
  @properties
    activePaneId: null
    children: []

class Pane
  @resolve 'activePaneId'

  isActive: ->
    @activePaneId is @id

  makeActive: ->
    @activePaneId = @id
```

This might not happen in this PR, but I'm envisioning Atom only having a single global, `atom`, which will be the root of a Telepath document that encompasses the entire state of the application. Any other globals will hang off the `atom` global, meaning objects in the document can always resolve them.

``` coffee
atom = Document.create() # create a root document
syntax = atom.set('syntax', new SyntaxGlobal) # assign a global property
workspace = atom.set('workspace', new Workspace) # create a child document

# once attached the child document can resolve properties on the root
workspace.resolve('syntax') is syntax # => true
```

If people don't want to use the resolution facilities, they can always reference things via the `atom` global:

``` coffee
class RebelObject
  constructor: ->
    @grammar = atom.syntax.selectGrammar('james-dean.coffee')
```
### Atomic Move Operations

As mentioned above, we need to be able to express structural changes to the document without explicitly removing subdocuments only to add them back somewhere else. The best solution I can come up with is atomic move operations. At the time of writing, this PR currently uses derived collections (discussed below) as a substitute for `move`, but I'm working on adding the move operation and changing that.

Replicated arrays and maps will both provide a `::move` method, which works as follows:

``` coffee
# Assuming pane1 and pane2 are both in the document, this moves the second item
# of pane1 to become the third item of pane2:
pane1.items.move(1, pane2.items, 2)

# You can also call ::move with an actual array element instead of an index:
item2 = pane1.items.get(1)
pane1.items.move(item2, pane2.items, 2)

# It also works for maps. This moves the value at key 'foo' in map1 to the 'bar'
# key in map2:
value = map1.get('foo')
map1.move('foo', map2, 'bar')
```

Atomic move operations should make it possible to split panes without creating detachment/removal ambiguity when a pane is replaced with an axis and vice versa.

``` coffee
class PaneAxis extends Model
  @properties
    orientation: 'horizontal'
    children: []

class Pane
  split: (side, orientation, items) ->
    # If needed, replace ourselves with a correctly-oriented container
    unless @getContainer().orientation is orientation
      newContainer = @parent.insertAfter(this, new PaneContainer({isRoot: false, orientation}))
      @parent.move(this, newContainer.children, 0)

    index = @parent.indexOf(this)
    index++ if side is 'after'
    @parent.insert(index, new Pane({items}))

  # our parent is an array, its parent is our container
  getContainer: -> @parent.parent
```
### Reactive Programming with Signals and Conditions

As discussed above, moving to asynchronous APIs makes traditional flow-control constructs less useful. But I'm beginning to think the non-blocking constraint is a blessing in disguise, in that it's going to push us to program reactively. For example, say we have a vertical pane axis that contains two panes, then one of its panes is destroyed. In this case, there's no longer a reason for the vertical pane axis to exist, and it should remove itself with its last pane, then destroy itself. The `Model` superclass includes a `.condition` class method that allows us to write this kind of behavior in a reactive style:

``` coffee
class PaneAxis
  properties:
    orientation: null
    children: []

  @condition
    when: @children.$length.becomesLessThan(2)
    call: 'reparentLastChild'

  @condition
    when: @children.$length.becomes(0)
    call: 'destroy'

  reparentLastChild: ->
    @children.move(@children.getLast(), @parent, @parent.indexOf(this))
```

The first condition says that when the length of the axis's children drops below two, it should reparent its last child. In the `reparentLastChild` method, the axis simply moves its last child to just before itself in the array that contains the axis. This causes the number of children to drop to 0, which triggers the second condition, destroying the axis. We could have just called `destroy` in `reparentLastChild`, but the condition is more decoupled. Regardless of _how_ the length of children reaches 0, we always destroy the axis when it occurs.

The `when` key in condition declarations expects a function that returns a **signal**, which represents a stream of events. A signal is a special kind of event emitter that can emit `'value'`, `'completed'`, and `'error'` events. Conditions will execute their action only when their signal emits a truthy value.

In this case, the signal is derived from a **behavior** (`@children.$length`). A behavior is a special kind of signal that always has a _present value_. When you subscribe to `'value'` on a behavior, your handler will be called immediately with the current value, and then called again whenever the behavior's value changes. In this case, the `becomesLessThan` method transforms the `$length` behavior into a signal that will emit `true` only when the behavior's value drops below 2.

Any emissary event emitter can return a signal based on events with a given name via the `::signal` method. Behaviors can be created based on an event name and an initial value. For example, the `$length` behavior for a replicated array is defined as follows:

``` coffee
@prototypePropertyAccessor, get: ->
  @behavior('length-changed', @getLength())
```

That means its initial value is based on `@getLength()`, and its value will change based on the `'length-changed'` event being emitted on the array.

Signals and behaviors are compositional. For example, `::becomesLessThan` could be defined in terms of `::becomes`, which accepts an arbitrary predicate.

``` coffee
class Signal
  becomesLessThan: (targetValue) ->
    @becomes (value) -> value < targetValue
```

`::becomes` can in turn be defined as in terms of more primitive methods:

``` coffee
class Signal
  becomes: (predicate) ->
    @map (value) -> !!predicate(value)
    .distinctUntilChanged()
    .changes()
```

That says we should convert the behavior to a behavior based on the result of the predicate for the underlying behavior's current value. Then we only emit events if we're changing from true or false and vice versa (no repeated values). Then, in case `becomes` was called on a behavior, we convert it into a signal of just the changes (not the current value) with `changes`.

Behaviors and signals are a work in progress, and are an extension to the [Emissary](https://github.com/atom/emissary) library which already contains our custom Emitter and Subscriber mixins. I opted to extend Emissary rather than use RxJS or Bacon.js because I don't like the hot-vs-cold signal distinction and wanted really clean integration with our subscriber and event-emitter patterns. This is core infrastructure, so I want to control it and incrementally develop it to suit our needs. I don't think fleshing it out will represent a major cost in the grand scheme.
### Derived Collections

Signals and behaviors give us structured abstractions for deriving streams of time-varying scalar values, but Telepath also offers tools for deriving _collections_ that change over time. The `Model` superclass offers `relatesToMany` and `relatesToOne` methods for associating derived collections with model instances. In this case, we're using `relatesToMany` combined with the `selectMany` method to maintain an up-to-date collection of all panes on the `PaneContainer`:

``` coffee
class PaneContainer
  @properties
    children: []
    activePaneId: null

  @relatesToMany 'panes', ->
    @children.selectMany (child) -> child.panes

class PaneAxis
  @properties
    orientation: null
    children: []

  @relatesToMany 'panes', ->
    @children.selectMany (child) -> child.panes

class Pane
  attached: ->
    @panes = [this]
```

`selectMany` is a lot like `flatMap`. It maps a function that returns collections over all the elements in `@children`, then flattens the result into a single collection. The difference between `selectMany` and `flatMap` is that `selectMany` returns a _derived_ collection, meaning it will always be kept up to date as elements are added/removed in the underlying arrays. Derived collections have convenient methods like `onEach`, which executes a callback for all current and future panes:

``` coffee
paneContainer.panes.onEach (pane) -> pane.addHeader(new TabStrip(pane))
```

Derives collections can be composed. Here, `relatesToOne` is used to define a singleton derived collection for the active pane:

```
class PaneContainer
  @properties
    children: []
    activePaneId: null

  @relatesToMany 'panes', ->
    @children.selectMany (child) -> child.panes

  @relatesToOne 'activePane', ->
    @panes.where(id: @$activePaneId)
```

The `activePane` is derived from the `panes` collection. We pass the `where` operator a behavior based on the `activePaneId`. Whenever the active pane id changes, the collection will update automatically and change the value of `activePane`. The `.hasOne` declaration automatically defines `$activePane`, a behavior based on the current active pane.

@kevinsawicki and I had a good talk last night that makes me doubt whether we need to do this. Here's the situation:

Our ability to version packages independently of atom core basically hinges on the stability of our core API. If we're able to make backward-compatible changes to core, then there's no imperative to commit repairs to broken packages in lock-step with our core changes, because nothing will break. This will have to be our approach when we launch private alpha, because otherwise we'll break other people's packages in addition to our own. Core API stability will be a high priority.

However, for the next two months we're going to make one last push to fix any outstanding issues with the design of our API. We may or may not be able to preserve backward compatibility for all packages during this transition. If it's easy to preserve, then I'm inclined to do so. But my top priority is getting the design in good shape as quickly as possible, so if backward compatibility is getting in the way, submoduling some or all of our core packages again _temporarily_ may be a good option. In this final push to improve the API before giving this to people, its stability is a low priority.

I'm going to attempt the MVVM refactoring in a way that maximizes backward compatibility and make a small number of non-backward compatible changes directly on master. Depending on our experience in the coming weeks, we may discover we don't need to submodule. On the other hand, I think it could be expedient as a temporary measure while things are in massive flux. I promise to stop breaking the world when we release, but the world isn't how I want it yet.

749,"We've had some deep discussion on #747 :airplane: about the conventions we want to adopt for documenting our source code.

On the other hand, we we want the experience of _working_ with documented source code to be as smooth and lightweight as possible and keep our source files looking sexy.

So far, the discussion has been about the full fidelity of TomDoc vs. the compactness and lower maintenance burden of less a less formal approach. After pondering this for a while, I think that by innovating on our documentation format we can satisfy all of these concerns. With this PR, I'd like to start a conversation about what that format might look like.

While it's true that TomDoc is a standard of sorts, I don't think it's meeting our needs well. My main criticism is that it feels very bulky, and it's causing our source files to feel extremely cluttered. We need a format that's simple for simple methods–on the order of a single line–but that also scales smoothly to five, ten, or even more lines as the need for documentation increases. I think this proposal can provide that.

An alternative is selectively loading stylesheets with the same name as the theme from the package's `stylesheet` directory (I remember a section in the docs talking about this with a 'not implemented' tag). I haven't looked too deeply into the pkg manager yet to know how difficult it might be.

651,"I'm working on creating an Emmet plugin for Atom.

Most of what needs to be done is overriding Emmet functionality to work with Atom's API. Most of the interactions with Emmet expect character index positions in a document. Basically, this necessitates translating `[row, column]` positions into the index position.

I'd like to add the `indexForBufferPosition and`bufferPositionForIndex` to translate between the two positions. You can see it [used here](https://github.com/atom/emmet/blob/1e274e258956ed67a14f059e1186405ef78194ab/lib/editor-proxy.coffee#L107-L116).

- [x] Improve the layout
- [ ] Make a light / dark theme for config
- [ ] Add a button to open the `~/.atom` directory
- [ ] Editor for the user stylesheet
- [ ] Keymaps editor
## Description

Now, when you press `meta-,`, instead of just loading your `.atom` directory we will load a custom configuration interface. It will contain various panels, some added by the core system and others added by packages that have `activateConfig` methods in their main modules. The forms read/write to/from the `config` global, and other windows detect the user's `config.cson` changing and reload the config automatically.

There's the beginnings of a rudimentary bindings system for form fields. You can give a form field a `name` and a `type` attribute that binds it to a config field. So an input element with a name of `editor.fontFamily` will automatically display and update that key path in the config.

It's also worth noting that it took a bit of trickery to get the form fields working properly. This may be of interest to @jbarnette, who ran into similar issues. There's a custom `native!` binding that you can assign in they keymap. If any element ever matches that binding, we will immediately abort processing in the keymap and let the browser handle the keypress as normal. I applied this binding to input elemetns that don't have the class of `hidden-input` for the arrow keys, tab, backspace, etc to allow them to function as normal. It just seems like overkill to always use editors instead of form fields. For simple interfaces, a form seems fine to me. And it will blend in better with select menus, etc.

In this PR, I've got an extraordinarily basic set of functionality working: non-RegExp searches, case sensitive searches, and whole word searches. What I'm most concerned about is validating whether I'm comprehending how search works. Here's what I'm observing:
1. Search latches onto the command panel, which uses Sam syntaxes
2. When you fire off a search, you call the command interpreter, which  takes a look at _commands.pegjs_ to determine what it is you want to do
3. After realizing you want to search, a new `RegexAddress` is constructed, and executed

406,"Picking up on an idea from _way back_ [in Janauary](https://github.com/github/atom/issues/129).

Personally, I believe mucking around with node-gyp and compiling native entities should be kept to a minimum. Especially when coming up with a cross-platform application, cross-platform features need to be respected. 

Among other things, `ag` doesn't really work too well on Windows. I would like to suggest switching to [`nak`](https://github.com/gjtorikian/nak) if possible.
### Advantages
- Cross platform (you got Node, you got `nak`)
- Streams results. This is key, I think. Think of how search results populate in through Sublime Text. `ag` (and currently, Atom) just dump a blob of search results. That's a wonky UX.
- Search results are _in order_. Whereas `ag` returns results like this:  
      `./vendor/themes/Zenburnesque.tmTheme`  
      `./vendor/underscore.js`  
  `nak` knows that you should search and list your current dir, before advancing alphabetically through the subdirs.
### Disadvantages

Over the last few weeks, `ag` got faster. I shaved 500ms off of `nak` in comparison searches, but it's still about four times slower. Here are some numbers:
- Searching for the word ""silver"" in all of atom (13300 files) 
  - `ag`: 0.240 seconds
  - `nak`: 1.516 seconds
- Searching for the word ""function"" in all of atom (13300 files) 
  - `ag`: 0.602 seconds
  - `nak`: 1.989s seconds
- Searching for the letter ""v"" in my dev dir (69329 files) 
  - `ag`: 10.42 seconds
  - `nak`: 13.37 seconds

Can `nak` be faster? Actually, yes. Since `console.log` is blocking, every time I stream back  a chunk of results I'm holding up the processing. If I drop the streaming results I can improve the speed a little more, but I kind of prefer the stream.
### Other search-y stuff

`ag` and `nak` both allow for whole word matching, case-sensitivity, non-regexps, _e.t.c._. Atom needs to figure out a way to do these things.

Also, `nak` supports find _and replace_ in files. You can also filter on the file level, _e.g._, `--ignore *.js` excludes JS files, `--include *.less` only checks LESS files. 
#### More ?!

`nak` can also be used to populate the fuzzy-file list. It takes around 300ms to get all the files in the Atom dir. Unfortunately, that's not in this PR, because I couldn't get it to work properly.
